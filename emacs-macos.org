** Article

Because I've configured my GNU emacs to [[../gnu-emacs-setup-for-os-x/index.html][automatically run in daemon mode]] I wish to 'use' emacs by running =emacsclient= exclusively. But emacsclient isn't an OS-X 'app' which means that I can't double click on a file to open it with emacsclient. It also means that I can't use the 'Open With' menu to edit a file via emacsclient. Here is how to resolve those issues.

*** Create an =emacsclient= app


To create the app, I used [[http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus][Platypus]]. It is a truly great little application that enables one to put a wrapper around a shell script (or, I suppose, an =a.out=) to make it act like a 'real' application.

1. Create a trivial shell script called =ec= which calls =emacsclient=. Make the script executable. I put it in my =~/bin/=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         #!/bin/bash
         # Start emacsclient and return immediately.
        /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient -n -c  " $@ "
   #+END_SRC

2. Optional: If you want your app to have the pretty GNU Emacs icon, copy =Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/Emacs.icns= to the temp dir.

3. Launch Platypus. In the Platypus UI, do the following:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        App Name              -->  'emacsclient'
        Script Type           -->  'bash'
        Script Path           -->  '~/bin/ec'
        Output                -->  'None'
        Accepts dropped items -->  'checked'
        Everything else       -->  'unchecked'

        Optional: Click the gear under the icon and set icon to:  Emacs.icns
   #+END_EXAMPLE

4. In Platypus, click on 'create'.

   This will create a 'real' OS-X application named =emacsclient.app= in your temp dir. Copy this =emacsclient.app= to =/Applications=.

You now have a functioning emacsclient OS-X 'application'.

*** =emacsclient.app= and File Extensions


The app created by Platypus worked fine. However, nothing had been done to associate file extensions with the =emacsclient.app=. Without those associations it would not be possible to, for example, double click a Python file and have emacsclient open it.

It seems like Platypus would offer a mechanism for associating file extensions with the application it generates, but I could not find one. Here's what I did.

=/Applications/emacsclient.app/Contents/Info.plist= contains an array of file extensions that emacsclient knows how to open; they are stored under the =CFBundleDocumentTypes= key. The array was essentially empty.

I decided that I wanted to take the list of supported extensions from the =Info.plist= under =Emacs.app= and insert them into the plist for =emacsclient.app=. But how to do this?

The =duti= utility looked promising, but it would not compile on El Capitan. It may have just been a matter of updating a version string in the config, but I didn't feel like investing time in the necessary research.

I believe that I could have used =plutil= and =PlistBuddy= to convert both plists to XML and then manually edit them, but seemed tedious and error-prone.

I was surprised to discover that Python includes =plistlib= in its standard distribution. It made things ridiculously easy.

The following code will extract a key value from a source plist and insert that same key:value into a destination plist, saving the modified destination plist as a new plist.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
      #!/usr/bin/env python
      # cppk.py -- This DOES NOT modify anything in /Applications

      import  sys ,  plistlib ,  os

      ( key ,  src ,  dest ,  new )  =  sys . argv [ 1 :]

      source  =  plistlib . readPlist ( src )
      destination  =  plistlib . readPlist ( dest )

      destination [ key ]  =  source [ key ]

      plistlib . writePlist ( destination ,  new )
#+END_SRC

Example usage:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
     $  E =/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Info.plist
     $  EC =/Applications/emacsclient.app/Contents/Info.plist
     $ ./cppk.py CFBundleDocumentTypes  $E  $EC ./Info.plist
#+END_SRC

This creates the desired plist and saves it as =./Info.plist=. I then copied =./Info.plist= to =emacsclient.app/Contents/Info.plist= (after making a backup copy).

To force OS-X to pick up the change, I ran =lsregister=, causing Launch Services to rebuild its database:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
      # Valid for OS-X 10.11.2.  If the path is invalid on your version,
      # run 'locate lsregister' to find it.

     %  F =/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework
     %  F +=/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework
     %  F +=/Versions/A/Support/lsregister

     %  " $F " -lint -kill -r -domain  local -domain system -domain user
#+END_SRC

This may take a while to complete.

*** Conclusion


After this point, =emacsclient= will appear in the 'Open With' menu. Additionally, it is now possible to globally associate emacsclient with file types so that it is the default application used to open them.

I can now double-click on a python file and have emacsclient open it.

I'd like to automate setting the global default application for certain file types (e.g., .py, .txt, etc.), but that will wait for another day.

[2020-06-05 Fri 13:32]

**** Article

I have used the [[http://emacsformacosx.com][Emacs for Mac OS-X]] distribution of Gnu Emacs for years and have been quite pleased with it. Emacs' =server-mode= is great in that it makes for very fast load times and it allows sharing buffer contents, kill rings, etc., between windows. However, I found it a little tricky to get it working perfectly on OS-X. These are my notes on how to install and configure it so that =server-mode= works correctly on OS-X.

Under =server-mode=, the =emacsclient= program is used to edit files. I have another note about how to [[../open-with-emacsclient/index.html][configure emacsclient as an OS-X application]]. This may be worth reading as well.

***** Configuration


1. Install Emacs for Mac OS-X.

2. Update your path:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         # Emacs.app binaries must come before /usr/bin
         # Using the apple provided emacsclient with a different
         # emacs in server mode is a common source of problems.
         PATH =/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin: $PATH
   #+END_SRC

3. Create a script named =ec= that invokes emacsclient with desired options. Note that this returns immediately; it does not wait for the edit to complete.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         #!/usr/bin/env bash
         # -n    --> Return immediately, don't wait for edit to complete
         # -a "" --> If emacs is not running in server mode, start it
         # -c    --> create a new frame instead of using existing frame
        emacsclient -n -a  "" -c  " $@ "
   #+END_SRC

4. Create a script named =ecw= that invokes emacsclient with desired options. Note that this command will not exit until the edit is complete.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         #!/usr/bin/env bash
         # -a "" --> If emacs is not running in server mode, start it
         # -c    --> create a new frame instead of using existing frame
        emacsclient -a  "" -c  " $@ "
   #+END_SRC

5. Many programs use the EDITOR and VISUAL environment variables to determine which editor to use. Set these up to use =ecw=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         export  EDITOR =ecw
         export  VISUAL =ecw
   #+END_SRC

Whenever you run =ec= or =ecw=, an emacs daemon in server-mode will be started, if one doesn't already exist.

This is the simplest emacs setup that I've used and it works well.

***** Lagniappe


While not specific to OS-X, this is germane to server-mode emacs.

I'm used to killing buffers with = C-x k=. When first starting to use server-mode, I started seeing warnings about a client still using the buffer that I was killing. For my (simple) use case, the following allows me to keep using my old muscle-memory to kill the buffer yet avoid the warning:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      ( add-hook  'server-switch-hook
             ( lambda  ()
               ( when  ( current-local-map )
                 ( use-local-map  ( copy-keymap  ( current-local-map ))))
               ( when  server-buffer-clients
                 ( local-set-key  ( kbd  "C-x k" )  'server-edit ))))
#+END_SRC

***** Alternate Configuration


Before I settled on the above approach, I configured OS-X to automatically start emacs in server-mode at boot time. This does work, but it isn't as clean as the above. Here's how to do it:

1. Create the plist =~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.fsf.gnu.emacs.plist= using an editor:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE


           version= "1.0" >

               Label
               org.fsf.gnu.emacs
               ProgramArguments

                  /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs
                  --daemon

               RunAtLoad

               KeepAlive

               ServiceDescription
               Gnu Emacs Daemon


   #+END_EXAMPLE

2. Install the plist:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        $ launchctl load -w  ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.fsf.gnu.emacs.plist
   #+END_SRC

Note: I made up =org.fsf.gnu.emacs=. There's nothing magic about it; it could be any unique value.

Now OS-X will start emacs in daemon mode and keep it running for you. I have had weird things happen with this approach, which is why I converted to the first method presented.

***** 'Open-with' and emacsclient


After creating an =emacsclient= app via Platypus, I was disappointed to notice that the app did not appear in the 'Open With' menu when a supported file was control-clicked on.

Here is how I took care of this issue.

=/Applications/emacsclient.app/Contents/Info.plist= contains an array of file extensions that it knows how to open; they are stored under the =CFBundleDocumentTypes= key. The array was empty, containing only a =*=.

I concluded that a suitable array could be copied from =Emacs.app= and set about trying to insert it into =emacsclient='s =Info.plist=. After a few hours of =PlistBuddy= and =plutil=, I was unable to get what I inserted as the array to be properly recognized.

This is why I don't like binary / non-editable configuration files. There's no reason that the plist shouldn't be editable text: YAML, XML, JSON, or whatever. A binary format for configuration files that can only be modified with dedicated tools is insane.

I finally dropped back to Python, having bypassed it initially, assuming that programming be the long road to get it done. I was surprised to see that Python includes =plistlib= in its standard distribution. It made things ridiculously easy.

The following code grabs the array from =Emacs.app=, and inserts it into a *copy* of =Info.plist= taken from =emacsclient.capp=. It saves the modified result as =Info.plist.new= in the current directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
      #!/usr/bin/env python

      # Run this script from the command line with the path to the Emacs.app
      # Info.plist as the first argument and the path to the emacsclient.app
      # Info.plist as the second argument.  'Info.plist.new' will be created
      # in current direcotory.

      import  sys ,  plistlib ,  os

      ( pl_from ,  pl_to )  =  sys . argv [ 1 :]

      plf  =  plistlib . readPlist ( pl_from )
      plt  =  plistlib . readPlist ( pl_to )

      plt [ 'CFBundleDocumentTypes' ]  =  plf [ 'CFBundleDocumentTypes' ]

      plistlib . writePlist ( plt ,  os . path . basename ( pl_to )  +  '.new' )
#+END_SRC

When this completes, copy the resulting =Info.plist.new= to =emacsclient.app/Contents/Info.plist= (after making a backup copy).

So that OS-X picks up the change, it is necessary to run =lsregister=, which causes Launch Services to rebuild its database. Here's how:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
      # Valid for OS-X 10.11.2.  If the path is invalid on yours,
      # run 'locate lsregister' to find it.

     %  F =/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework
     %  F +=/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework
     %  F +=/Versions/A/Support/lsregister

     %  $F -lint -kill -r -domain  local -domain system -domain user
#+END_SRC

This may take 15-30 seconds to run. After that, =emacsclient= will appear in your 'Open With' menu the next time you use it; it's worth the effort.

***  16 August 2020 Trying out gccemacs on macOS


Been wanting to try Andrea Corallo's [[http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html][gccemacs]]. Followed [[https://github.com/AllenDang][Allen Dang]]'s handy [[https://gist.github.com/AllenDang/f019593e65572a8e0aefc96058a2d23e][instructions]] to build it on macOS.

Though not had much of a chance to play with the new install, here's what I did to get up and running...

#+END_EXAMPLE

Ok so run:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  make -j4  NATIVE_FAST_BOOT=1
  make install
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will take *hours* and give your fans a good workout.

**** Symlink Emacs.app/Contents/lisp


Without synlinking, opening Emacs.app from finder fails silently, so symlink as follows. Btw, if you changed $GCCEMACS_PREFIX, use that path prefix instead.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ln -s $( brew --prefix)/opt/gccemacs/share/emacs/28.0.50/lisp nextstep/Emacs.app/Contents/
#+END_EXAMPLE

ps. Without symlink, you won't see an error unless the binary is executed explicitly from the terminal (ie. nextstep/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs), and then you'd see something like

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  nextstep/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs
  emacs: dlopen(nextstep/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/../lisp/emacs-lisp/eln-x86_64-apple-darwin19.4.0-abff6ce99a055711/lisp-mode.eln, 1): image not found
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Remove ~/emacs.d


You likely want to start with a clean install, byte-compiling all packages with the latest Emacs version. In any case, rename ~/emacs.d (for backup?) or remove ~/emacs.d.

**** init.el config


Ensure /exec-path/ and /LIBRARY_PATH/ both point to locations in $GCCEMACS_PREFIX and finally set /comp-deferred-compilation/. I wrapped mine in /exec-path-from-shell/, setting early in init.el should be enough.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ( use-package  exec-path-from-shell
     :ensure t
     :config
    (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)
    ( if ( and (fboundp 'native-comp-available-p)
             (native-comp-available-p))
        ( progn
          (message  "Native comp is available")
          (add-to-list 'exec-path (expand-file-name  "~/homebrew/opt/gccemacs/bin"))
          (setenv  "LIBRARY_PATH" (concat (getenv  "LIBRARY_PATH")
                                         ( when (getenv  "LIBRARY_PATH")
                                            ":")
                                         (car (file-expand-wildcards
                                               (expand-file-name  "~/homebrew/opt/gcc/lib/gcc/*")))))
           ;;  Only set after LIBRARY_PATH can find gcc libraries.
          ( setq comp-deferred-compilation t))
      (message  "Native comp is *not* available")))
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Launch Emacs.app


You're good to go. Open Emacs.app via finder or shell:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  open nextstep/Emacs.app
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Deferred compilation logs


After setting /comp-deferred-compilation/ (in init.el config section), .elc files should be asyncronously compiled. Function definition should be updated to native compiled equivalent.

Look out for an **Async-native-compile-log** buffer. Should have content like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Compiling .emacs.d/elpa/moody-20200514.1946/moody.el...
  Compiling .emacs.d/elpa/minions-20200522.1052/minions.el...
  Compiling .emacs.d/elpa/persistent-scratch-20190922.1046/persistent-scratch.el...
  Compiling .emacs.d/elpa/which-key-20200721.1927/which-key.el...
  ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

Can also check for .eln files:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  find ~/.emacs.d -iname *.eln | wc -l
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  149
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Article

The [[https://langserver.org/][language server protocol]] was proposed by Microsoft as a way for different editors and development environments to share language analysis backends

This post describes how to configure Emacs, [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]] and the [[https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server][palantir python-language-server]] for improved code intelligence when working on Python projects. (I'm planning a companion post for Emacs, C++ and the [[https://github.com/cquery-project/cquery][cquery language server]].)

*** Goal


Before starting, it is motivating to see what we are working towards.

With a correctly configured setup, Emacs will sport, amongst others, improved completion with interactive documentation, imenu navigation, documentation on hover, and really snazzy find definitions (=M-.=) and find references.

*** Pre-requisites on the Python side


Install the =python-language-server= into the virtual environment, or user environment, that you're planning to use.

These days, I tend to use =pipenv=:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sh
     cd my_project
   pipenv install python-language-server [all ]
 #+END_EXAMPLE

The =[all]= means that it installs all optional providers, e.g. yapf formatting.

*** Pre-requisites on the Emacs side


In Emacs, install the required and some optional packages using for example =M-x package-install=:

- =lsp-mode= - the main language server protocol package
- =lsp-ui= - UI-related LSP extras, such as the sideline info, docs, flycheck, etc.
- =company-lsp= - company-backend for LSP-based code completion.
- [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][ =projectile=]] or [[https://github.com/technomancy/find-file-in-project][ =find-file-in-project=]] - we use a single function from here to determine the root directory of a project.

*** Emacs configuration


Add the following to your Emacs =init.el=, and don't forget to read the comments.

If you're not yet using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][=use-package=]] now would be a good time to upgrade.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE emacs-lisp
    ( use-package  lsp-mode
     :ensure  t
     :config

     ;; make sure we have lsp-imenu everywhere we have LSP
     ( require  'lsp-imenu )
     ( add-hook  'lsp-after-open-hook  'lsp-enable-imenu )
     ;; get lsp-python-enable defined
     ;; NB: use either projectile-project-root or ffip-get-project-root-directory
     ;;     or any other function that can be used to find the root directory of a project
     ( lsp-define-stdio-client  lsp-python  "python"
                              #' projectile-project-root
                              ' ( "pyls" ))

     ;; make sure this is activated when python-mode is activated
     ;; lsp-python-enable is created by macro above
     ( add-hook  'python-mode-hook
               ( lambda  ()
                 ( lsp-python-enable )))

     ;; lsp extras
     ( use-package  lsp-ui
       :ensure  t
       :config
       ( setq  lsp-ui-sideline-ignore-duplicate  t )
       ( add-hook  'lsp-mode-hook  'lsp-ui-mode ))

     ( use-package  company-lsp
       :config
       ( push  'company-lsp  company-backends ))

     ;; NB: only required if you prefer flake8 instead of the default
     ;; send pyls config via lsp-after-initialize-hook -- harmless for
     ;; other servers due to pyls key, but would prefer only sending this
     ;; when pyls gets initialised (:initialize function in
     ;; lsp-define-stdio-client is invoked too early (before server
     ;; start)) -- cpbotha
     ( defun  lsp-set-cfg  ()
       ( let  (( lsp-cfg  ` ( :pyls  ( :configurationSources  ( "flake8" )))))
         ;; TODO: check lsp--cur-workspace here to decide per server / project
         ( lsp--set-configuration  lsp-cfg )))

     ( add-hook  'lsp-after-initialize-hook  'lsp-set-cfg ))
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Putting it all together


Importantly, use [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/pyvenv][=pyenv=]] or something similar to switch to the relevant virtualenv before opening the first Python file.

When you open the file, the =pyls= should be automatically started up, and you can edit away with LSP-powered code intelligence.

This often gives better and more detailed results than [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][=elpy=]], probably because pyls uses a mix of static and dynamic (introspection-based) analysis.

Furthermore, the handling of LSP servers in Emacs can be unified, giving the same consistent level of support across a whole range of programming languages.
