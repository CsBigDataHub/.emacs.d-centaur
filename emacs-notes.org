***  Section commands

These commands are for navigation and to change the visibility of
sections.

| Key                | Description                                                       |
|--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~TAB~                | toggle body of current section                                    |
| ~C-<tab>~            | cycle visibility of current section and its children              |
| ~M-<tab>~            | cycle visibility of all diff sections                             |
| ~s-<tab>~            | cycle visibility of all sections                                  |
| ~1~, ~2~, ~3~, ~4~         | show surrounding sections up to level N, hide deeper levels       |
| ~M-1~, ~M-2~, ~M-3~, ~M-4~ | globally show sections up to level N, hide deeper levels          |
| ~^~                  | goto parent section                                               |
| ~p~                  | goto beginning of section, from there to previous section         |
| ~n~                  | goto next section                                                 |
| ~M-p~                | goto beginning of section, from there to previous sibling section |
| ~M-n~                | goto next sibling section                                         |

***  Buffer commands

| Key   | Description                                                                     |
|-------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~g~     | refresh current buffer and status buffer, possibly revert file-visiting buffers |
| ~G~     | refresh all Magit buffers and revert all file-visiting buffers in repository    |
| ~q~     | bury the current Magit buffer, restoring previous window configuration          |
| ~C-u q~ | kill the current Magit buffer, restoring previous window configuration          |

***  Various common commands

| Key | Description                                   |
|-----+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC~ | scroll up (1)                                 |
| ~DEL~ | scroll down (1)                               |
| ~RET~ | show the thing at point in another buffer (2) |
| ~j~   | jump somewhere (3)                            |
| ~$~   | show output of recent calls to git            |

- (1) In most Magit buffers this scrolls the current buffer.
  In log buffers this instead scrolls the diff buffer shown
  in another window.
- (2) What is being shown depends on the context.
- (3) Where this jumps to depends on the context.

***  Various assorted commands

| Key   | Description                   |
|-------+-------------------------------|
| ~i~     | add a gitignore rule globally |
| ~I~     | add a gitignore rule locally  |
| ~x~     | reset using ~--mixed~           |
| ~C-u x~ | reset using ~--hard~            |

***  Prefix commands

You can use these when you're in the ~magit-status~ buffer. The list below can also be accessed by pressing ~h~, so there's no need to memorize this wiki page. Commands will open popup buffers listing infix arguments and suffix commands.

| Key   | Description          |
|-------+----------------------|
| ~A~     | cherry-pick          |
| ~b~     | branch               |
| ~B~     | bisect               |
| ~c~     | commit               |
| ~d~     | diff                 |
| ~E~     | ediff                |
| ~f~     | fetch                |
| ~F~     | pull                 |
| ~h~, ~?~  | show popup of popups |
| ~l~     | log                  |
| ~m~     | merge                |
| ~M~     | remote               |
| ~o~     | submodule            |
| ~P~     | push                 |
| ~r~     | rebase               |
| ~t~     | tag                  |
| ~T~     | note                 |
| ~V~     | revert               |
| ~w~     | apply patches        |
| ~C-u y~ | list refs (1)        |
| ~z~     | stash                |
| ~!~     | run git or gui tool  |

- (1) Actually ~y~ is bound to a popup/prefix command, but it is one of
  the few popups which default to a suffix command and therefore has to
  be called with a prefix argument to actually show the popup buffer.

***  Applying changes

| Key | Description                    |
|-----+--------------------------------|
| ~a~   | apply the change at point      |
| ~k~   | discard the change at point    |
| ~s~   | stage the change at point      |
| ~S~   | stage all unstaged changes     |
| ~u~   | unstage the change at point    |
| ~U~   | unstage all staged changes (1) |
| ~v~   | reverse the change at point    |

- (1) Actually this asks for a commit to reset the index too.  If you
  just press ~RET~, then what this equivalent to unstaging everything.
  If that is too confusing then just bind this key to ~magit-unstage-all~.

***  Diffing

These commands show diffs or manipulate the diff arguments used to
generate the diffs in the current buffer.

| Key   | Description                                   |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~RET~ | (on commit) show commit                       |
| ~RET~ | (on stash) show stash                         |
| ~d~   | show diffing popup                            |
| ~D~   | show popup for changing diff arguments        |
| ~e~   | use ediff to stage, compare, or stage (dwim)  |
| ~E~   | show ediffing popup (for when dwimming fails) |
| ~+~   | show more context lines                       |
| ~-~   | show less context lines                       |
| ~0~   | show default amount of context lines (three)  |

***  Rebasing

The following commands can be used from the ~magit-rebase-popup~ which is activated using ~r~

| Key   | Description                                   |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~i~   | Start an interactive rebase sequence.         |
| ~f~   | Combine squash and fixup commits with their intended targets. |
| ~m~   | Edit a single older commit using rebase.      |
| ~w~   | Reword a single older commit using rebase.    |
| ~k~   | Remove a single older commit using rebase.    |

Whilst performing a rebase the following editing sequences are available.

| Key   | Description                                   |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~C-c C-c~ | Finish the current editing session by returning with exit code 0. Git then uses the rebase instructions it finds in the file. |
| ~C-c C-k~ |Cancel the current editing session by returning with exit code 1. Git then forgoes starting the rebase sequence. |
| ~RET~   | Show the commit on the current line in another buffer and select that buffer. |
| ~SPC~   | Show the commit on the current line in another buffer without selecting that buffer. If the revision buffer is already visible in another window of the current frame, then instead scroll that window up. |
| ~DEL~   | Show the commit on the current line in another buffer without selecting that buffer. If the revision buffer is already visible in another window of the current frame, then instead scroll that window down. |
| ~p~     | Move to previous line.                      |
| ~n~     | Move to next line.                          |
| ~M-p~   | Move the current commit (or command) up.    |
| ~M-n~   | Move the current commit (or command) down.  |
| ~r~     | Edit message of commit on current line.     |
| ~e~     | Stop at the commit on the current line.     |
| ~s~     | Meld commit on current line into previous commit, and edit message. |
| ~f~     | Meld commit on current line into previous commit, discarding the current commit’s message. |
| ~k~     | Kill the current action line.               |
| ~c~     | Use commit on current line.                 |
| ~x~     | Insert a shell command to be run after the proceeding commit. |
| ~y~     | Read an arbitrary commit and insert it below current line. |
| ~C-x u~ | Undo some previous changes. Like undo but works in read-only buffers. |

If a rebase is already in progress then ~magit-rebase-popup~ offers the following commands.

| Key   | Description                                   |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~r~   | Restart the current rebasing operation.       |
| ~s~   | Skip the current commit and restart the current rebase operation. |
| ~e~   | Edit the todo list of the current rebase operation. |
| ~a~   | Abort the current rebase operation, restoring the original branch. |

**** Article

[[http://www.howardabrams.com][[[/img/me-circle.png]]]]

[[http://www.howardism.org][Howardisms]]

Babblings of an aging geek in love with the Absurd, his family, and his own hubris.... oh, and Lisp.

The following is a transcript of the slides and demonstration of EShell I gave to both the PDX and London Emacs User groups. Hopefully this page will be easier to copy/paste...

***** Introduction


John Wiegley created EShell in 1998:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  /...as a way to provide a UNIX-like/ /environment on a Windows NT machine./
#+END_QUOTE

Part of Emacs since v21.

*Personally?*

- Started with =ksh=
- Used a lot of shells...
- Tried =eshell= soon after its birth
- Shelved it since it /wasn't shell-enough/
- Rediscovered years later
- Finally /got it/...

*Contents:* /What's all this then?/

- What EShell really is
- How to use it effectively
- Hacking

***** Shell... The Good


- Can be /immensely powerful/... at times
- Pipes and redirection are a staple
- Utilizing small, focused /text-oriented/ executables
- Complex command re-invocation
- History okay ... nothing like Emacs

***** Shell... The Bad


- Commands? Like key sequences, only longer
- Needing /completion/ to run commands?
- Loops? Not terrible
- Copy and pasting ... with a mouse!? (at least use =M-x shell=)

***** Shell... The WTF?


- Best part: /extensibility!/

- But what an awful language:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     if [ $( echo  "$IN" | cut -c  1-3 ) ==  'abc' ];  then
        #  ...
     fi
  #+END_EXAMPLE

- May be Turing complete, but so what.

  But, but, but... we *know* the shell!

Seen Rich Hickey's [[https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy][Simple Made Easy]] talk? The shell is /easy/ because it is so close.

***** iPython


Python REPL with shell-like features.

- Understands a /current directory/
- Has /some/ shell-like commands, =cat=
- Doesn't easily execute programs: =system=
- Executes Python scripts: =run=

******* Slide Notes


Demonstrated the iPython approach by entering the following into an =ipython= REPL:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Python 2.7.12 (default, Nov 19 2016, 06:48:10)
  Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

  IPython 2.4.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
  ?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
  %quickref -> Quick reference.
  help      -> Python's own help system.
  object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.

  In [1]: 2 ** 60
  Out[1]: 1152921504606846976

  In [2]: cd /tmp/testing
  /tmp/testing

  In [3]: ls
  pi.py  pi.rb  README  src/  tests/

  In [4]: cat pi.py
  import math

  print(math.pi)
  print(math.cos(math.pi))

  In [5]: chmod a+x pi.py
    File "", line 1
      chmod a+x pi.py
            ^
  SyntaxError: invalid syntax


  In [6]: run pi
  3.14159265359
  -1.0

  In [7]: system ruby pi.rb
  Out[7]: ['-0.9999999999964793', '-3.141592653589793']

  In [8]: cat README
  Ciao, all you cool cats.
  Oh, and hey to all my dawgs.

  In [9]: def cat(arg=None):
     ...:     return 'Meow!'
     ...:

  In [10]: cat
  Out[10]:

  In [11]: cat()
  Out[11]: 'Meow!'

  In [12]: cat README
    File "", line 1
      cat README
               ^
  SyntaxError: invalid syntax
#+END_EXAMPLE

In answer to your question, I haven't looked to see why we have an array when calling the =system= function.

If you want to see what /shell-like/ functions iPython has, type =%= and hit the Tab key, which shows something like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  In [13]: %
  Display all 122 possibilities? (y or n)
  %%!                      %doctest_mode            %pfile

#+END_EXAMPLE

***** EShell as a Shell


- Most “interactive language” interfaces choose:

  - Language-specific REPL, or
  - Shell-focused program worker

- As a shell:

  - Concept of a /current directory/
  - =popd=, =pushd=, and =dirs=
  - Globbing Expressions
  - Quotes /often/ optional

    - Do you care about spaces?
    - Double and single quotes are interchangeable

  - Aliases: =alias ll 'ls -l'=

- Emacs shell interaction:

  - =M-n= / =M-p= scroll through history
  - =M-r= select from history
  - =C-c C-p= move to previous prompts
  - =C-c C-l= list history in buffer

- Tempted to think =eshell= is like =shell=

******* Slide Notes


At this point, we start an =eshell= process, and demonstrate some of the /shell-like features/ that we'd expect for something that ends with -shell:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ cd /tmp/testing

  $ pwd
  /tmp/testing

  $ ls
  README  pi.py  pi.rb  src  tests

  $ cat README
  Ciao, all you cool cats.
  Oh, and hey to all my dawgs.

  $ ruby pi.rb
  -0.9999999999964793
  -3.141592653589793

  $ python *.py
  3.141592653589793
  -1.0

  $ echo "Hello"
  Hello

  $ echo 'Hello'
  Hello

  $ echo Hello
  Hello

  $ alias ee 'find-file-other-window $1'

  $ ee pi.rb
  #
#+END_EXAMPLE

This last example shows that =ee= opens a window in another window. Note, however, that the alias is actually calling an Emacs function, not another executable (although it could).

***** EShell as a REPL


- Lisp expressions work within parens
- Unlike /shell/, EShell:

  - Commands can be executables or Emacs functions
  - Distinguishes strings, numbers, and lists

- EShell is marriage of /two syntax parsers/:

  - *Shell Expressions*
  - *Lisp Expressions*

- A single line can mix the two!

******* Slide Notes


To demonstrate how eshell is a REPL, let's type a simple Lisp expression:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ (length "hi")
  2

  $ length "hi"      # ← Works since shell parser calls Lisp
  2

  $ length hi        # ← Works since shell reads as string
  2

  $ (+ 1 3)
  4

  $ + 1 3            # ← Works since shell reads as number
  4

  $ * 3 (+ 1 2)      # ← Shows both shell and lisp parsers
  9

  $ ls
  README  pi.py  pi.rb  src  tests

  $ length *        # Globs return a list
  5

  $ length *.py
  1

  $ touch 'and go.py'

  $ ls *.py
  and go.py  pi.py

  $ echo *.py        # ← More clear that globs are lists
  ("and go.py" "pi.py")
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** Eshell's Parsers


- *Lisp parser*:

  - =( ... )=
  - =$( ... )= ... useful for string evaluation

- *Shell parser*:

  - /no parens/ ... in other words, the default
  - ={ ... }=
  - =${ ... }= ... useful for string evaluation

- In /shell parser/, reference variables with =$=

******* Slide Notes


To drive home the differences between /shell/ and /lisp/ parsers, let's enter the following in =eshell= buffer:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ setq ANSWER 42   # ← Normal Emacs variable
  42

  $ numberp $ANSWER  # ← Use $ to get value.
  t

  $ setq UNANSWER "41"
  41

  $ stringp $UNANSWER
  t

  $ mod ANSWER 5    # ← Forgot the $ with shell parser
  Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p, "ANSWER"

  $ mod $ANSWER 5   # ← Math without expr
  2

  $ (mod ANSWER 5)  # ← Lisp doesn't need $ for vars
  2

  $ (mod $ANSWER 5)
  Symbol's value as variable is void: $ANSWER

  $ echo $UNANSWER:$ANSWER
  41:42

  $ echo $UNANSWER:(mod ANSWER 5)   # ← Let's talk about predicate filters later in the show
  Malformed modification time modifier `m'

  $ echo $UNANSWER:$(mod ANSWER 5)
  41:2

  $ echo $ANSWER:${mod $ANSWER 5}
  42:2
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** Shell-like Loops


- Syntactic sugar around =loop=.
- Code following =in= is a generate list
- Use trailing ={ ... }= for side-effects

******* Slide Notes


See [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EshellForLoop][this page]] for more details.

Show off the =for= concept, by entering the following in an =eshell= buffer. Note that the =do= syntax for some shells doesn't work. Loops look more like =csh='s:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ for F in *; do echo "I like $F"; done
  Symbol's value as variable is void: do
  done: command not found

  $ for F in * { echo "I like $F" }
  I like README
  I like and go.py
  I like pi.py
  I like pi.rb
  I like src/
  I like tests/

  # A list can be generated in any way, like with Lisp:
  $ for N in (number-sequence 1 5) { % $ANSWER $N }
  0
  0
  0
  2
  2

  # Generate the list with eshell parser syntax:
  $ for N in {number-sequence 1 5} { % $ANSWER $N }
  0
  0
  0
  2
  2

  # Note: Can't use Lisp as the loop's action:
  $ for N in {number-sequence 1 5} (% ANSWER N)

  # Unless you embed the Lisp in shell parser:
  $ for N in {number-sequence 1 5} {(% ANSWER N)}
  0
  0
  0
  2
  2
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** Function or Executable?


What about the executable =find= vs. Emacs' =find= function?

*Precedence Order:*

1. Eshell aliases
2. Emacs functions that being with =eshell/= prefix
3. Normal Emacs functions (don't need to be =interactive=)
4. Shell executables

Of course, this is customizable:

- =eshell-prefer-lisp-functions= prefer Lisp functions to external commands
- =eshell-prefer-lisp-variables= prefer Lisp variables to environmentals

******* Slide Notes


To demonstrate the /precedence/ order for eshell commands, I created a script called =foobar= that simply contains:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   # !/bin/ sh

   echo  "Called: executable"
#+END_EXAMPLE

Without anything else, this will be called:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ which foobar
  /home/howard/bin/foobar

  $ foobar
  Called: executable
#+END_EXAMPLE

We now create a regular Emacs function in Lisp (notice that it isn't =interactive=):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ( defun  foobar  ()
     "Called: function" )
#+END_EXAMPLE

It now takes precedence /over/ the executable:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ which foobar
  foobar is a Lisp function

  $ foobar
  Called: function
#+END_EXAMPLE

Create another Lisp function, this has the =eshell/= prefix. Again, no need to make =interactive=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ( defun  eshell/foobar  ()
     "Called: eshell function" )
#+END_EXAMPLE

And this new function over-shadows the others:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ which foobar
  eshell/foobar is a Lisp function

  $ foobar
  Called: eshell function
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally, we define an alias, and demonstrate that it over-shadows all the others:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ alias foobar 'echo "Called: alias"'

  $ which foobar
  foobar is an alias, defined as "echo "Called: alias""

  $ foobar
  Called: alias
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** Globbin' Filters


- The =*= glob-thing has filters
- Great if you can remember the syntax:

  - =.= for files
  - =/= for directories
  - =r= if readable
  - =w= if writable
  - =L= filtering based on file size
  - =m= filtering on modification time

- The filters can be /stacked/, e.g. =.L=
- Can't remember? =C-c M-q= Or: =eshell-display-predicate-help=

******* Slide Notes


Using a directory for this purpose, we can demonstrate EShell's /predicate filter/ feature. First, list all /files/:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ls *(.)
  README  and go.py  pi.py  pi.rb

  $ ls *(^/)   # ← Inverse of directories are often files
  README  and go.py  pi.py  pi.rb
#+END_EXAMPLE

Demonstrate combining modifiers by listing all files with more than 50 bytes to them:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ls *(.L+50)
  README  pi.py
#+END_EXAMPLE

After creating three files (using the =touch= executable), we can list all /empty/ files (that is, those that have less than 1 byte):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ls *(L-1)
  and go.py  goo.py  grip.py  swam.py
#+END_EXAMPLE

Or those modified less than 40 seconds ago:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ls *(.ms-40)
  README  and go.py  goo.py  grip.py  pi.py  pi.rb  src  swam.py  tests
#+END_EXAMPLE

Modified after we modified =goo.py=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ls *(.m-'goo.py')
  grip.py  swam.py
#+END_EXAMPLE

And /before/ we modified =goo.py=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ls *(.m+'goo.py')
  README  and go.py  pi.py  pi.rb
#+END_EXAMPLE

I love this. I can get a list of my journal entries larger than 5000 bytes, and open =dired= showing only those files:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ dired ~/journal/2017*(L+5000)
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** Modifiers


Syntactic sugar to convert strings and lists.

Can't remember? =C-c M-m= Or: =eshell-display-modifier-help=

Eshell filters and modifiers remind me of regular expressions

Don't know the eshell-way? Just drizzle Lisp.

******* Slide Notes


Convert a string with a /modifier/:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ echo "hello"(:U)
  HELLO
#+END_EXAMPLE

Convert all files, as strings, in a list:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ echo *(:U)
  ("README" "AND GO.PY" "GOO.PY" "GRIP.PY" "PI.PY" "PI.RB" "SRC/" "SWAM.PY" "TESTS/")
#+END_EXAMPLE

Modifiers can be /combined/ with filters:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ echo *(.L-1:U)
  ("AND GO.PY" "GOO.PY" "GRIP.PY" "SWAM.PY")
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, we often split these and use the =for= loop:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ for F in *(.L-1) { mv $F $F(:U) }

  $ ls
  AND GO.PY  GOO.PY  GRIP.PY  README  SWAM.PY  pi.py  pi.rb  src  tests
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now, all empty files are in upper case.

You'd think you could reverse a list with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ echo ("hello" "cruel" "world")(:R)
  No matches found: ("hello" "cruel" "world")
#+END_EXAMPLE

Since the shell parser doesn't like that syntax, perhaps you could set the list to a variable and work with that?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ setq BADDABING (list "hello" "cruel" "world")
  ("hello" "cruel" "world")

  $ echo $BADDABING(:R)
  ("world" "cruel" "hello")
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you find this stuff too odd and confusing, you can always fall back to Lisp:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ reverse (list "hello" "cruel" "world")
  ("world" "cruel" "hello")
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** EShell Hack Points


While offering similar shell experience, Eshell is really /hackable/!

Here are some ideas...

****** Write your Own Functions


- Functions /for/ Eshell: =eshell/=

- They do not need to be =interactive=

- Functions /should/ assume =&rest= for arguments:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     ( defun  eshell/do-work  ( &rest args )
       "Do some work in an optional directory."
       ( let  ((some-dir  ( if args
                            ( pop args )
                        default-directory )))
         (message  "Work in %s" some-dir )))
  #+END_EXAMPLE

******* Slide Notes


Using =&rest= allows your functions to behave more like shell functions:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ do-work
  Work in /tmp/testing/

  $ do-work /home/howard/bin
  Work in /home/howard/bin
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** Remote Connections


To have eshell work on a remote server:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ( let  ((default-directory  "/ssh:your-host.com:public/" ))
     (eshell ))
#+END_EXAMPLE

My personal project:

- Connect to my /hypervisor controller/
- Download and store a list of /virtual machines/
- Use =ido-completing-read= to select a host / ip
- Generate a Tramp URL for =default-directory=

[[file:eshell-present-fav-hosts.png]]

******* Slide Notes


Here is a simplified example that might be a helpful start:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ( defvar  eshell-fav-hosts  (make-hash-table  :test 'equal )
     "Table of host aliases for IPs or other actual references." )

   (puthash  "web-server"  "172.217.4.14" eshell-fav-hosts )
   (puthash  "slc-jumpbox"  "10.93.254.176" eshell-fav-hosts )
   ;;  ...

   ( defun  eshell-favorite  (hostname  &optional root dir )
     "Start an shell experience on HOSTNAME, that can be an alias to
   a virtual machine from my 'cloud' server. With prefix command,
   opens the shell as the root user account."
     ( interactive
      (list
       (ido-completing-read  "Hostname: "
                            (hash-table-keys  (eshell-fav-hosts )))))

     ( when  (equal current-prefix-arg ' ( 4 ))
       ( setq root t ))
     ( when  (not dir )
       ( setq dir  "" ))

     ( let*  ((ipaddr  (gethash hostname eshell-fav-hosts hostname ))
            (trampy  ( if  (not root )
                        (format  "/ssh:%s:%s"       ipaddr dir )
                      (format  "/ssh:%s|sudo:%s:%s" ipaddr ipaddr dir )))
            (default-directory trampy ))
       (eshell )))
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** Extending Predicates


The User predicate =(U)= /could/ have been written:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ( defun  file-owned-current-uid-p  (file )
     ( when  (file-exists-p file )
         (=  (nth  2  (file-attributes file ))
            (user-uid ))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then add it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   (add-hook 'eshell-pred-load-hook  ( lambda  ()
     (add-to-list 'eshell-predicate-alist
             ' (?U . 'file-owned-current-uid-p ))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

My *engineering notebook* is a directory of files.

Most of my files have =#+FILETAGS= entries.

I can /filter/ based on these tag entries.

I have to parse text following predicate key.

******* Slide Notes


Assuming the =pi.py= script is owned by the =root= user, we can show which ones I own:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ls *(.U)
  AND GO.PY  GOO.PY  GRIP.PY  README  SWAM.PY  pi.rb
#+END_EXAMPLE

And which ones I don't:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ls *(^U)
  pi.py
#+END_EXAMPLE

My engineering notes contains quite a few files:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ length ~/technical/*(.)
  598
#+END_EXAMPLE

For instance, one file in my engineering notebook starts with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   #+TITLE:   Perfect Square
   #+AUTHOR:  Howard Abrams
   #+EMAIL:   howard.abrams@gmail.com
   #+DATE:    2013 Jun 06
   #+FILETAGS:   programming clojure

  Haitao posed a question: How do you write a function that determines
  if a number is a   perfect square.  You know, 9 and 25 are both perfect
  squares because their square roots are natural integers.

  While I have a brute force approach with an imperative loop in my
  head, I'm curious if I could do it with Lisp...
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notice the line that starts with =#+FILETAGS:= ... I can get the files that /contain/ a word on this line, with my new =T= predicate:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ length ~/technical/*(.T'clojure')
  45
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** Replacing Pipes


Pipes for /shell/ are flexible, but...

- Shell's text processing is limited
- Need arsenal of tiny, cryptic programs
- Re-run many times since debug pipe steps

Emacs is pretty good at text processing

- =keep-lines= / =flush-lines= instead of =grep=
- =replace-string=, et. al instead of =sed=

In EShell, redirect output to Emacs buffer:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ some-command > #
#+END_EXAMPLE

After editing the buffer, use it:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ bargs # mv % /tmp/testing
#+END_EXAMPLE

Reference buffers as =#= with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ( setq eshell-buffer-shorthand t )
#+END_EXAMPLE

Or use keybinding, =C-c M-b=

******* Slide Notes


To demonstrate this feature, I first put a string in a new buffer, =fling=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ echo hello > #
#+END_EXAMPLE

And displayed the buffer contents just to be sure.

Next, let's overwrite the contents of that buffer:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ls -1 > #
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now I call =keep-lines= to choose only the python files, and =flush-lines= to remove all files that contain =go=.

To show that I can now get the remaining files, I pass them to =echo= with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ bargs # echo
  ("GRIP.PY" "SWAM.PY" "pi.py")
#+END_EXAMPLE

I might actually do something like this with the function (notice the =%= character will be substituted with the list of files):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ mkdir oddities

  $ bargs # mv % oddities

  $ ls oddities
  GRIP.PY  SWAM.PY  pi.py
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** Bargs Code


Initial implementation of =bargs=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ( defun  eshell/-buffer-as-args  (buffer separator command )
     "Takes the contents of BUFFER, and splits it on SEPARATOR, and
   runs the COMMAND with the contents as arguments. Use an argument
   `%' to substitute the contents at a particular point, otherwise,
   they are appended."
     ( let*  ((lines  ( with-current-buffer buffer
                     (split-string
                      (buffer-substring-no-properties  (point-min )  (point-max ))
                     separator )))
            (subcmd  ( if  (-contains? command  "%" )
                        (-flatten  (-replace  "%" lines command ))
                      (-concat command lines )))
            (cmd-str   (string-join subcmd  " " )))
       (message cmd-str )
       (eshell-command-result cmd-str )))

   ( defun  eshell/bargs  (buffer  &rest command )
     "Passes the lines from BUFFER as arguments to COMMAND."
     (eshell/-buffer-as-args buffer  "\n" command ))

   ( defun  eshell/sargs  (buffer  &rest command )
     "Passes the words from BUFFER as arguments to COMMAND."
     (eshell/-buffer-as-args buffer nil command ))
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** EShell Summary


- *Advantages*:

  - Similar shell experience between operating systems
  - Much more extendable, hackable and funner

- *Disadvantages*:

  - Pipes go through Emacs buffers... not efficient

  - Programs that need special displays:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       (add-to-list 'eshell-visual-commands  "top" )
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    For commands that have options that trigger curses/pager:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       (add-to-list 'eshell-visual-options ' ( "git"  "--help" ))
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    If command has a ncurses/pager /sub-commands/, use:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       (add-to-list 'eshell-visual-subcommands
         ' ( "git"  "log"  "diff"  "show" ))
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Also set =eshell-destroy-buffer-when-process-dies=.

    /My goal was to inspire potential hackery.../

*** Article

Using [[https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags][universal ctags]] is as simple as:

1. Run over a project /( =-R= is to walk the project recursively, and =-e= is to use Emacs-compatible syntax)/:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      $ ctags -eR
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   *Alternatively* if you like to only include files with certain extensions, you can use =-a= /(append, creates a file if doesn't exist)/ option with =find= utility, like:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      $ find -name "*.cpp" -print -or -name "*.h" -print -or -name "*.hxx" -print -or -name "*.cxx" -print | xargs ctags -ea
   #+END_EXAMPLE

2. Run M- x visit-tags-table in Emacs, and navigate to the created TAGS file.

Org-mode is a fabulous organizational tool originally built by Carsten Dominik that operates on plain text files. Org-mode is part of Emacs.

***** <<sec-1>> 1 How To Use This Document


This document assumes you've had some exposure to org-mode already so concepts like the agenda, capture mode, etc. won't be completely foreign to you. More information about org-mode can be found in the [[http://orgmode.org/index.html#sec-4.1][Org-Mode Manual]] and on the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/][Worg Site]].

I have been using org-mode as my personal information manager for years now. I started small with just the default =TODO= and =DONE= keywords. I added small changes to my workflow and over time it evolved into what is described by this document.

I still change my workflow and try new things regularly. This document describes mature workflows in my current org-mode setup. I tend to document changes to my workflow 30 days after implementing them (assuming they are still around at that point) so that the new workflow has a chance to mature.

Some of the customized Emacs settings described in this document are set at their default values. This explicitly shows the setting for important org-mode variables used in my workflow and to keep my workflow behaviour stable in the event that the default value changes in the future.

This document is available as an [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.org][org file]] which you can load in Emacs and tangle with =C-c C-v C-t= which will create org-mode.el in the same directory as the org-mode.org file. This will extract all of the elisp examples in this document into a file you can include in your .emacs file.

***** <<sec-3>> 3 Change History - What's new


This is version =2015.06-5-gf5bb= of this document. This document is created using the publishing features of =org-mode= git version =release_8.2.10-42-g2e1bc42=.

The source for this document can be found as a [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.org][plain text org file]]. I try to update this document about once a month.

The change history for this document can be found at [[http://git.norang.ca/?p=org-mode-doc.git;a=summary][git://git.norang.ca/org-mode-doc.git]].

***** <<sec-4>> 4 Getting Started


Getting started with =org-mode= is really easy. You only need a few lines in your emacs startup to use the latest version of org-mode from the =git= repository.

****** <<sec-4-1>> 4.1 Getting org-mode with Git


I keep a copy of the org-mode =git= repository in =~/git/org-mode/=. This clone was created with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   cd ~/git
  git clone git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git
#+END_EXAMPLE

To update and get new commits from the org-mode developers you can use

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   cd ~/git/org-mode
  git pull
  make uncompiled
#+END_EXAMPLE

I run uncompiled source files in my setup so the uncompiled =make= target is all you need.

I normally track the =master= branch in the org-mode repository.

****** <<sec-4-2>> 4.2 Org-Mode Setup


The following setup in my .emacs enables =org-mode= for most buffers. =org-mode= is the default mode for =.org=, =.org_archive=, and =.txt= files.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;;
   ;;;  Org Mode
   ;;;
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name  "~/git/org-mode/lisp"))
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '( "\\. \\ ( org \\ | org_archive \\ | txt \\ ) $" . org-mode))
  ( require ' org)
   ;;
   ;;  Standard key bindings
  (global-set-key  "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
  (global-set-key  "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
  (global-set-key  "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)
#+END_EXAMPLE

That's all you need to get started using headlines and lists in org-mode.

The rest of this document describes customizations I use in my setup, how I structure org-mode files, and other changes to fit the way I want org-mode to work.

****** <<sec-4-3>> 4.3 Organizing Your Life Into Org Files


Tasks are separated into logical groupings or projects. Use separate org files for large task groupings and subdirectories for collections of files for multiple projects that belong together.

Here are sample files that I use.

The following org files collect non-work related tasks:

| Filename     | Description                                |
|--------------+--------------------------------------------|
| todo.org     | Personal tasks and things to keep track of |
| gsoc2009.org | Google Summer of Code stuff for 2009       |
| farm.org     | Farm related tasks                         |
| mark.org     | Tasks related to my son Mark               |
| org.org      | Org-mode related tasks                     |
| git.org      | Git related tasks                          |

The following org-file collects org capture notes and tasks:

| Filename   | Description         |
|------------+---------------------|
| refile.org | Capture task bucket |

The following work-related org-files keep my business notes (using fictitious client names)

| Filename    | Description                             |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------|
| norang.org  | Norang tasks and notes                  |
| XYZ.org     | XYZ Corp tasks and notes                |
| ABC.org     | ABC Ltd tasks                           |
| ABC-DEF.org | ABC Ltd tasks for their client DEF Corp |
| ABC-KKK.org | ABC Ltd tasks for their client KKK Inc  |
| YYY.org     | YYY Inc tasks                           |

Org-mode is great for dealing with multiple clients and client projects. An org file becomes the collection of projects, notes, etc. for a single client or client-project.

Client ABC Ltd. has multiple customer systems that I work on. Separating the tasks for each client-customer into separate org files helps keep things logically grouped and since clients come and go this allows entire org files to be added or dropped from my agenda to keep only what is important visible in agenda views.

Other org files are used for publishing only and do not contribute to the agenda. See [[#Publishing][Publishing and Exporting]] for more details.

****** <<sec-4-4>> 4.4 Agenda Setup


Here is my current =org-agenda-files= setup.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-agenda-files (quote ( "~/git/org"
                                  "~/git/org/client1"
                                  "~/git/client2")))
#+END_EXAMPLE

=org-mode= manages the =org-agenda-files= variable automatically using =C-c [= and =C-c ]= to add and remove files respectively. However, this replaces my directory list with a list of explicit filenames instead and is not what I want. If this occurs then adding a new org file to any of the above directories will not contribute to my agenda and I will probably miss something important.

I have disabled the =C-c [= and =C-c ]= keys in =org-mode-hook= to prevent messing up my list of directories in the =org-agenda-files= variable. I just add and remove directories manually in my =.emacs= file. Changing the list of directories in =org-agenda-files= happens very rarely since new files in existing directories are automatically picked up.

I also disable the comment function =C-c ;= since I never use those. I kept accidentally hitting this key sequence when doing =C-c singlequote= for editing source blocks.

In the example above I have =~/git/client2= in a separate git repository from ~/git/org. This gives me the flexibility of leaving confidential information at the client site and having all of my personal information available everywhere I use org-mode. I synchronize my personal repositories on multiple machines and skip the confidential info on the non-client laptop I travel with. =org-agenda-files= on this laptop does not include the =~/git/client2= directory.

****** <<sec-4-5>> 4.5 Org File Structure


Most of my org files are set up with level 1 headings as main categories only. Tasks and projects normally start as level 2.

Here are some examples of my level 1 headings in

=todo.org=:

- Special Dates

  Includes level 2 headings for

  - Birthdays
  - Anniversaries
  - Holidays

- Finances

- Health and Recreation

- House Maintenance

- Lawn and Garden Maintenance

- Notes

- Tasks

- Vehicle Maintenance

- Passwords

=norang.org=:

- System Maintenance
- Payroll
- Accounting
- Finances
- Hardware Maintenance
- Tasks
- Research and Development
- Notes
- Purchase Order Tracking
- Passwords

Each of these level 1 tasks normally has a =property drawer= specifying the category for any tasks in that tree. Level 1 headings are set up like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   * Health and Recreation
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CATEGORY: Health
     :END:
    ...
   * House Maintenance
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CATEGORY: House
     :END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-4-6>> 4.6 Key bindings


I live in the agenda. To make getting to the agenda faster I mapped =F12= to the sequence =C-c a= since I'm using it hundreds of times a day.

I have the following custom key bindings set up for my emacs (sorted by frequency).

| Key     | For                                             | Used       |

| C-c c   | Capture a task                                  | Very Often |
| C-F11   | Clock in a task (show menu with prefix)         | Often      |
| f9 g    | Gnus - I check mail regularly                   | Often      |
| f5      | Show todo items for this subtree                | Often      |
| S-f5    | Widen                                           | Often      |

| f9 f    | Boxquote insert a file                          | Sometimes  |
| f9 i    | Info manual                                     | Sometimes  |
| f9 I    | Punch Clock In                                  | Sometimes  |
| f9 O    | Punch Clock Out                                 | Sometimes  |
| f9 o    | Switch to org scratch buffer                    | Sometimes  |
| f9 s    | Switch to scratch buffer                        | Sometimes  |
| f9 h    | Hide other tasks                                | Rare       |
| f7      | Toggle line truncation/wrap                     | Rare       |
| f9 T    | Toggle insert inactive timestamp                | Rare       |
| C-c a   | Enter Agenda (minimal emacs testing)            | Rare       |

Here is the keybinding setup in lisp:

    (gnus-make-directory  "/tmp/publish"))

  ( defun  bh/switch-to-scratch ()
    (interactive)
    (switch-to-buffer  "*scratch*"))
#+END_EXAMPLE

The main reason I have special key bindings (like =F11=, and =F12=) is so that the keys work in any mode. If I'm in the Gnus summary buffer then =C-u C-c C-x C-i= doesn't work, but the =C-F11= key combination does and this saves me time since I don't have to visit an org-mode buffer first just to clock in a recent task.

***** <<sec-5>> 5 Tasks and States


I use one set of TODO keywords for all of my org files. Org-mode lets you define TODO keywords per file but I find it's easier to have a standard set of TODO keywords globally so I can use the same setup in any org file I'm working with.

The only exception to this is this document :) since I don't want =org-mode= hiding the =TODO= keyword when it appears in headlines. I've set up a dummy =#+SEQ_TODO: FIXME FIXED= entry at the top of this file just to leave my =TODO= keyword untouched in this document.

****** <<sec-5-1>> 5.1 TODO keywords


I use a light colour theme in emacs. I find this easier to read on bright sunny days.

Here are my =TODO= state keywords and colour settings:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-todo-keywords
        (quote ((sequence  "TODO(t)"  "NEXT(n)"  "|"  "DONE(d)")
                (sequence  "WAITING(w@/!)"  "HOLD(h@/!)"  "|"  "CANCELLED(c@/!)"  "PHONE"  "MEETING"))))

  (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
        (quote (( "TODO"  :foreground  "red"  :weight bold)
                ( "NEXT"  :foreground  "blue"  :weight bold)
                ( "DONE"  :foreground  "forest green"  :weight bold)
                ( "WAITING"  :foreground  "orange"  :weight bold)
                ( "HOLD"  :foreground  "magenta"  :weight bold)
                ( "CANCELLED"  :foreground  "forest green"  :weight bold)
                ( "MEETING"  :foreground  "forest green"  :weight bold)
                ( "PHONE"  :foreground  "forest green"  :weight bold))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* <<sec-5-1-1>> 5.1.1 Task States


Tasks go through the sequence =TODO= -> =DONE=.

The following diagram shows the possible state transitions for a task.

[[file:normal_task_states.png]]

******* <<sec-5-1-2>> 5.1.2 Project Task States


I use a lazy project definition. I don't like to bother with manually stating 'this is a project' and 'that is not a project'. For me a project definition is really simple. If a task has subtasks with a todo keyword then it's a project. That's it.

Projects can be defined at any level - just create a task with a todo state keyword that has at least one subtask also with a todo state keyword and you have a project. Projects use the same todo keywords as regular tasks. One subtask of a project needs to be marked =NEXT= so the project is not on the stuck projects list.

******* <<sec-5-1-3>> 5.1.3 Phone Calls


Telephone calls are special. They are created in a done state by a capture task. The time of the call is recorded for as long as the capture task is active. If I need to look up other details and want to close the capture task early I can just =C-c C-c= to close the capture task (stopping the clock) and then =f9 SPC= to resume the clock in the phone call while I do other things.

[[file:phone_states.png]]

******* <<sec-5-1-4>> 5.1.4 Meetings


Meetings are special. They are created in a done state by a capture task. I use the MEETING capture template when someone interrupts what I'm doing with a question or discussion. This is handled similarly to phone calls where I clock the amount of time spent with whomever it is and record some notes of what was discussed (either during or after the meeting) depending on content, length, and complexity of the discussion.

The time of the meeting is recorded for as long as the capture task is active. If I need to look up other details and want to close the capture task early I can just =C-c C-c= to close the capture task (stopping the clock) and then =f9 SPC= to resume the clock in the meeting task while I do other things.

[[file:meeting_states.png]]

****** <<sec-5-2>> 5.2 Fast Todo Selection


Fast todo selection allows changing from any task todo state to any other state directly by selecting the appropriate key from the fast todo selection key menu. This is a great feature!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-use-fast-todo-selection t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Changing a task state is done with =C-c C-t KEY=

where =KEY= is the appropriate fast todo state selection key as defined in =org-todo-keywords=.

The setting

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-treat-S-cursor-todo-selection-as-state-change nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

allows changing todo states with S-left and S-right skipping all of the normal processing when entering or leaving a todo state. This cycles through the todo states but skips setting timestamps and entering notes which is very convenient when all you want to do is fix up the status of an entry.

****** <<sec-5-3>> 5.3 TODO state triggers


I have a few triggers that automatically assign tags to tasks based on state changes. If a task moves to =CANCELLED= state then it gets a =CANCELLED= tag. Moving a =CANCELLED= task back to =TODO= removes the =CANCELLED= tag. These are used for filtering tasks in agenda views which I'll talk about later.

The triggers break down to the following rules:

- Moving a task to =CANCELLED= adds a =CANCELLED= tag
- Moving a task to =WAITING= adds a =WAITING= tag
- Moving a task to =HOLD= adds =WAITING= and =HOLD= tags
- Moving a task to a done state removes =WAITING= and =HOLD= tags
- Moving a task to =TODO= removes =WAITING=, =CANCELLED=, and =HOLD= tags
- Moving a task to =NEXT= removes =WAITING=, =CANCELLED=, and =HOLD= tags
- Moving a task to =DONE= removes =WAITING=, =CANCELLED=, and =HOLD= tags

The tags are used to filter tasks in the agenda views conveniently.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-todo-state-tags-triggers
        (quote (( "CANCELLED" ( "CANCELLED" . t))
                ( "WAITING" ( "WAITING" . t))
                ( "HOLD" ( "WAITING") ( "HOLD" . t))
                (done ( "WAITING") ( "HOLD"))
                ( "TODO" ( "WAITING") ( "CANCELLED") ( "HOLD"))
                ( "NEXT" ( "WAITING") ( "CANCELLED") ( "HOLD"))
                ( "DONE" ( "WAITING") ( "CANCELLED") ( "HOLD")))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** <<sec-6>> 6 Adding New Tasks Quickly with Org Capture


Org Capture mode replaces remember mode for capturing tasks and notes.

To add new tasks efficiently I use a minimal number of capture templates. I used to have lots of capture templates, one for each org-file. I'd start org-capture with =C-c c= and then pick a template that filed the task under =* Tasks= in the appropriate file.

I found I still needed to refile these capture tasks again to the correct location within the org-file so all of these different capture templates weren't really helping at all. Since then I've changed my workflow to use a minimal number of capture templates -- I create the new task quickly and refile it once. This also saves me from maintaining my org-capture templates when I add a new org file.

****** <<sec-6-1>> 6.1 Capture Templates


When a new task needs to be added I categorize it into one of a few things:

- A phone call (p)
- A meeting (m)
- An email I need to respond to (r)
- A new task (t)
- A new note (n)
- An interruption (j)
- A new habit (h)

and pick the appropriate capture task.

Here is my setup for org-capture

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-directory  "~/git/org")
  (setq org-default-notes-file  "~/git/org/refile.org")

   ;;  I use C-c c to start capture mode
  (global-set-key (kbd  "C-c c") 'org-capture)

   ;;  Capture templates for: TODO tasks, Notes, appointments, phone calls, meetings, and org-protocol
  (setq org-capture-templates
        (quote (( "t"  "todo" entry (file  "~/git/org/refile.org")
                  "* TODO %?\n%U\n%a\n"  :clock-in t  :clock-resume t)
                ( "r"  "respond" entry (file  "~/git/org/refile.org")
                  "* NEXT Respond to %:from on %:subject\nSCHEDULED: %t\n%U\n%a\n"  :clock-in t  :clock-resume t  :immediate-finish t)
                ( "n"  "note" entry (file  "~/git/org/refile.org")
                  "* %? :NOTE:\n%U\n%a\n"  :clock-in t  :clock-resume t)
                ( "j"  "Journal" entry (file+datetree  "~/git/org/diary.org")
                  "* %?\n%U\n"  :clock-in t  :clock-resume t)
                ( "w"  "org-protocol" entry (file  "~/git/org/refile.org")
                  "* TODO Review %c\n%U\n"  :immediate-finish t)
                ( "m"  "Meeting" entry (file  "~/git/org/refile.org")
                  "* MEETING with %? :MEETING:\n%U"  :clock-in t  :clock-resume t)
                ( "p"  "Phone call" entry (file  "~/git/org/refile.org")
                  "* PHONE %? :PHONE:\n%U"  :clock-in t  :clock-resume t)
                ( "h"  "Habit" entry (file  "~/git/org/refile.org")
                  "* NEXT %?\n%U\n%a\nSCHEDULED: %(format-time-string \"%<<%Y-%m-%d %a .+1d/3d>>\")\n:PROPERTIES:\n:STYLE: habit\n:REPEAT_TO_STATE: NEXT\n:END:\n"))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Capture mode now handles automatically clocking in and out of a capture task. This all works out of the box now without special hooks. When I start a capture mode task the task is clocked in as specified by =:clock-in t= and when the task is filed with =C-c C-c= the clock resumes on the original clocking task.

The quick clocking in and out of capture mode tasks (often it takes less than a minute to capture some new task details) can leave empty clock drawers in my tasks which aren't really useful. Since I remove clocking lines with 0:00 length I end up with a clock drawer like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   *  TODO  New Capture Task
     :LOGBOOK:
     :END:
     [2010-05-08 Sat 13:53]
#+END_EXAMPLE

I have the following setup to remove these empty =LOGBOOK= drawers if they occur.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Remove empty LOGBOOK drawers on clock out
  ( defun  bh/remove-empty-drawer-on-clock-out ()
    (interactive)
    ( save-excursion
      (beginning-of-line 0)
      (org-remove-empty-drawer-at  "LOGBOOK" (point))))

  (add-hook 'org-clock-out-hook 'bh/remove-empty-drawer-on-clock-out 'append)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-6-2>> 6.2 Separate file for Capture Tasks


I have a single org file which is the target for my capture templates.

I store notes, tasks, phone calls, and org-protocol tasks in =refile.org=. I used to use multiple files but found that didn't really have any advantage over a single file.

Normally this file is empty except for a single line at the top which creates a =REFILE= tag for anything in the file.

The file has a single permanent line at the top like this

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   #+FILETAGS: REFILE
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-6-3>> 6.3 Capture Tasks is all about being FAST


Okay I'm in the middle of something and oh yeah - I have to remember to do that. I don't stop what I'm doing. I'm probably clocking a project I'm working on and I don't want to lose my focus on that but I can't afford to forget this little thing that just came up.

So what do I do? Hit =C-c c= to start capture mode and select =t= since it's a new task and I get a buffer like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   *  TODO
     [2010-08-05 Thu 21:06]

      Capture Tasks is all about being FAST
#+END_EXAMPLE

Enter the details of the TODO item and =C-c C-c= to file it away in refile.org and go right back to what I'm really working on secure in the knowledge that that item isn't going to get lost and I don't have to think about it anymore at all now.

The amount of time I spend entering the captured note is clocked. The capture templates are set to automatically clock in and out of the capture task. This is great for interruptions and telephone calls too.

***** <<sec-7>> 7 Refiling Tasks


Refiling tasks is easy. After collecting a bunch of new tasks in my refile.org file using capture mode I need to move these to the correct org file and topic. All of my active org-files are in my =org-agenda-files= variable and contribute to the agenda.

I collect capture tasks in refile.org for up to a week. These now stand out daily on my block agenda and I usually refile them during the day. I like to keep my refile task list empty.

****** <<sec-7-1>> 7.1 Refile Setup


To refile tasks in org you need to tell it where you want to refile things.

In my setup I let any file in =org-agenda-files= and the current file contribute to the list of valid refile targets.

I've recently moved to using IDO to complete targets directly. I find this to be faster than my previous complete in steps setup. At first I didn't like IDO but after reviewing the documentation again and learning about =C-SPC= to limit target searches I find it is much better than my previous complete-in-steps setup. Now when I want to refile something I do =C-c C-w= to start the refile process, then type something to get some matching targets, then =C-SPC= to restrict the matches to the current list, then continue searching with some other text to find the target I need. =C-j= also selects the current completion as the final target. I like this a lot. I show full outline paths in the targets so I can have the same heading in multiple subtrees or projects and still tell them apart while refiling.

I now exclude =DONE= state tasks as valid refile targets. This helps to keep the refile target list to a reasonable size.

Here is my refile configuration:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;  Targets include this file and any file contributing to the agenda - up to 9 levels deep
  (setq org-refile-targets (quote ((nil  :maxlevel . 9)
                                   (org-agenda-files  :maxlevel . 9))))

   ;  Use full outline paths for refile targets - we file directly with IDO
  (setq org-refile-use-outline-path t)

   ;  Targets complete directly with IDO
  (setq org-outline-path-complete-in-steps nil)

   ;  Allow refile to create parent tasks with confirmation
  (setq org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes (quote confirm))

   ;  Use IDO for both buffer and file completion and ido-everywhere to t
  (setq org-completion-use-ido t)
  (setq ido-everywhere t)
  (setq ido-max-directory-size 100000)
  (ido-mode (quote both))
   ;  Use the current window when visiting files and buffers with ido
  (setq ido-default-file-method 'selected-window)
  (setq ido-default-buffer-method 'selected-window)
   ;  Use the current window for indirect buffer display
  (setq org-indirect-buffer-display 'current-window)

   ;;;;  Refile settings
   ;  Exclude DONE state tasks from refile targets
  ( defun  bh/verify-refile-target ()
     "Exclude todo keywords with a done state from refile targets"
    (not (member (nth 2 (org-heading-components)) org-done-keywords)))

  (setq org-refile-target-verify-function 'bh/verify-refile-target)
#+END_EXAMPLE

To refile a task to my =norang.org= file under =System Maintenance= I just put the cursor on the task and hit =C-c C-w= and enter =nor C-SPC sys RET= and it's done. IDO completion makes locating targets a snap.

****** <<sec-7-2>> 7.2 Refiling Tasks


Tasks to refile are in their own section of the block agenda. To find tasks to refile I run my agenda view with =F12 SPC= and scroll down to second section of the block agenda: =Tasks to Refile=. This view shows all tasks (even ones marked in a =done= state).

Bulk refiling in the agenda works very well for multiple tasks going to the same place. Just mark the tasks with =m= and then =B r= to refile all of them to a new location. Occasionally I'll also refile tasks as subtasks of the current clocking task using =C-2 C-c C-w= from the =refile.org= file.

Refiling all of my tasks tends to take less than a minute so I normally do this a couple of times a day.

****** <<sec-7-3>> 7.3 Refiling Notes


I keep a =* Notes= headline in most of my org-mode files. Notes have a =NOTE= tag which is created by the capture template for notes. This allows finding notes across multiple files easily using the agenda search functions.

Notes created by capture tasks go first to =refile.org= and are later refiled to the appropriate project file. Some notes that are project related get filed to the appropriate project instead of under the catchall =* NOTES= task. Generally these types of notes are specific to the project and not generally useful -- so removing them from the notes list when the project is archived makes sense.

****** <<sec-7-4>> 7.4 Refiling Phone Calls and Meetings


Phone calls and meetings are handled using capture mode. I time my calls and meetings using the capture mode template settings to clock in and out the capture task while the phone call or meeting is in progress.

Phone call and meeting tasks collect in =refile.org= and are later refiled to the appropriate location. Some phone calls are billable and we want these tracked in the appropriate category. I refile my phone call and meeting tasks under the appropriate project so time tracking and reports are as accurate as possible.

***** <<sec-8>> 8 Custom agenda views


I now have one block agenda view that has everything on it. I also keep separate single view agenda commands for use on my slower Eee PC - since it takes prohibitively long to generate my block agenda on that slow machine. I'm striving to simplify my layout with everything at my fingertips in a single agenda on my workstation which is where I spend the bulk of my time.

Most of my old custom agenda views were rendered obsolete when filtering functionality was added to the agenda in newer versions of =org-mode= and now with block agenda functionality I can combine everything into a single view.

Custom agenda views are used for:

- Single block agenda shows the following

  - overview of today
  - Finding tasks to be refiled
  - Finding stuck projects
  - Finding NEXT tasks to work on
  - Show all related tasks
  - Reviewing projects
  - Finding tasks waiting on something
  - Findings tasks to be archived

- Finding notes
- Viewing habits

If I want just today's calendar view then =F12 a= is still faster than generating the block agenda - especially if I want to view a week or month's worth of information, or check my clocking data. In that case the extra detail on the block agenda view is never really needed and I don't want to spend time waiting for it to be generated.

My block agenda view looks like this when not narrowed to a project. This shows top-level projects and =NEXT= tasks but hides the project details since we are not focused on any particular project.

*NOTE:* This agenda screen shot is out of date and does not currently match the agenda setup in this document. This will be fixed soon.

[[file:block-agenda-nonproject.png]]

After selecting a project (with =P= on any task in the agenda) the block agenda changes to show the project and any subprojects in the Projects section. Tasks show project-related tasks that are hidden when not narrowed to a project.

This makes it easy to focus on the task at hand.

*NOTE:* This agenda screen shot is out of date and does not currently match the agenda setup in this document. This will be fixed soon.

[[file:block-agenda-project.png]]

I generally work top-down on the agenda. Things with deadlines and scheduled dates (planned to work on today or earlier) show up in the agenda at the top.

My day goes generally like this:

- Punch in (this starts the clock on the default task)
- Look at the agenda and make a mental note of anything important to deal with today
- Read email and news

  - create notes, and tasks for things that need responses with org-capture

- Check refile tasks and respond to emails
- Look at my agenda and work on important tasks for today

  - Clock it in
  - Work on it until it is =DONE= or it gets interrupted

- Work on tasks
- Make journal entries ( =C-c c j=) for interruptions
- Punch out for lunch and punch back in after lunch
- work on more tasks
- Refile tasks to empty the list

  - Tag tasks to be refiled with =m= collecting all tasks for the same target
  - Bulk refile the tasks to the target location with =B r=
  - Repeat (or refile individually with =C-c C-w=) until all refile tasks are gone

- Mark habits done today as DONE
- Punch out at the end of the work day

****** <<sec-8-2>> 8.2 What do I work on next?


Start with deadlines and tasks scheduled today or earlier from the daily agenda view. Then move on to tasks in the =Next Tasks= list in the block agenda view. I tend to schedule current projects to 'today' when I start work on them and they sit on my daily agenda reminding me that they need to be completed. I normally only schedule one or two projects to the daily agenda and unschedule things that are no longer important and don't deserve my attention today.

When I look for a new task to work on I generally hit =F12 SPC= to get the block agenda and follow this order:

- Pick something off today's agenda

  - deadline for today (do this first - it's not late yet)
  - deadline in the past (it's already late)
  - a scheduled task for today (it's supposed to be done today)
  - a scheduled task that is still on the agenda
  - deadline that is coming up soon

- pick a NEXT task
- If you run out of items to work on look for a NEXT task in the current context pick a task from the Tasks list of the current project.

******* <<sec-8-2-1>> 8.2.1 Why keep it all on the =NEXT= list?


I've moved to a more GTD way of doing things. Now I just use a =NEXT= list. Only projects get tasks with =NEXT= keywords since stuck projects initiate the need for marking or creating =NEXT= tasks. A =NEXT= task is something that is available to work on /now/, it is the next logical step in some project.

I used to have a special keyword =ONGOING= for things that I do a lot and want to clock but never really start/end. I had a special agenda view for =ONGOING= tasks that I would pull up to easily find the thing I want to clock.

Since then I've moved away from using the =ONGOING= todo keyword. Having an agenda view that shows =NEXT= tasks makes it easy to pick the thing to clock - and I don't have to remember if I need to look in the =ONGOING= list or the =NEXT= list when looking for the task to clock-in. The =NEXT= list is basically 'what is current' - any task that moves a project forward. I want to find the thing to work on as fast as I can and actually do work on it - not spend time hunting through my org files for the task that needs to be clocked-in.

To drop a task off the =NEXT= list simply move it back to the =TODO= state.

****** <<sec-8-3>> 8.3 Reading email, newsgroups, and conversations on IRC


When reading email, newsgroups, and conversations on IRC I just let the default task (normally =** Organization=) clock the time I spend on these tasks. To read email I go to Gnus and read everything in my inboxes. If there are emails that require a response I use org-capture to create a new task with a heading of 'Respond to ' for each one. This automatically links to the email in the task and makes it easy to find later. Some emails are quick to respond to and some take research and a significant amount of time to complete. I clock each one in it's own task just in case I need that clocked time later. The capture template for Repond To tasks is now scheduled for today so I can refile the task to the appropriate org file without losing the task for a week.

Next, I go to my newly created tasks to be refiled from the block agenda with =F12 a= and clock in an email task and deal with it. Repeat this until all of the 'Respond to ' tasks are marked =DONE=.

I read email and newgroups in Gnus so I don't separate clocked time for quickly looking at things. If an article has a useful piece of information I want to remember I create a note for it with =C-c c n= and enter the topic and file it. This takes practically no time at all and I know the note is safely filed for later retrieval. The time I spend in the capture buffer is clocked with that capture note.

****** <<sec-8-4>> 8.4 Filtering


So many tasks, so little time. I have hundreds of tasks at any given time (373 right now). There is so much stuff to look at it can be daunting. This is where agenda filtering saves the day.

It's 11:53AM and I'm in work mode just before lunch. I don't want to see tasks that are not work related right now. I also don't want to work on a big project just before lunch... so I need to find small tasks that I can knock off the list.

How do we do this? Get a list of NEXT tasks from the block agenda and then narrow it down with filtering. Tasks are ordered in the NEXT agenda view by estimated effort so the short tasks are first -- just start at the top and work your way down. I can limit the displayed agenda tasks to those estimates of 10 minutes or less with =/ + 1= and I can pick something that fits the minutes I have left before I take off for lunch.

******* <<sec-8-4-1>> 8.4.1 Automatically removing context based tasks with / RET


=/ RET= in the agenda is really useful. This awesome feature was added to org-mode by John Wiegley. It removes tasks automatically by filtering based on a user-provided function.

At work I have projects I'm working on which are assigned by my manager. Sometimes priorities changes and projects are delayed to sometime in the future. This means I need to stop working on these immediately. I put the project task on =HOLD= and work on something else. The =/ RET= filter removes =HOLD= tasks and subtasks (because of tag inheritance).

At home I have some tasks tagged with =farm= since these need to be performed when I am physically at our family farm. Since I am there infrequently I have added =farm= to the list of auto-excluded tags on my system. I can always explicitly filter to just =farm= tasks with =/ TAB farm RET= when I am physically there.

I have the following setup to allow =/ RET= to filter tasks based on the description above.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ( defun  bh/org-auto-exclude-function (tag)
     "Automatic task exclusion in the agenda with / RET"
    (and ( cond
          ((string= tag  "hold")
           t)
          ((string= tag  "farm")
           t))
         (concat  "-" tag)))

  (setq org-agenda-auto-exclude-function 'bh/org-auto-exclude-function)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This lets me filter tasks with just =/ RET= on the agenda which removes tasks I'm not supposed to be working on now from the list of returned results.

This helps to keep my agenda clutter-free.

***** <<sec-9>> 9 Time Clocking


Okay, I admit it. I'm a clocking fanatic.

I clock everything at work. Org-mode makes this really easy. I'd rather clock too much stuff than not enough so I find it's easier to get in the habit of clocking everything.

This makes it possible to look back at the day and see where I'm spending too much time, or not enough time on specific projects. This also helps a lot when you need to estimate how long something is going to take to do -- you can use your clocking data from similar tasks to help tune your estimates so they are more accurate.

Without clocking data it's hard to tell how long something took to do after the fact.

I now use the concept of =punching in= and =punching out= at the start and end of my work day. I punch in when I arrive at work, punch out for lunch, punch in after lunch, and punch out at the end of the day. Every minute is clocked between punch-in and punch-out times.

Punching in defines a default task to clock time on whenever the clock would normally stop. I found that with the default org-mode setup I would lose clocked minutes during the day, a minute here, a minute there, and that all adds up. This is especially true if you write notes when moving to a DONE state - in this case the clock normally stops before you have composed the note -- and good notes take a few minutes to write.

My clocking setup basically works like this:

- Punch in (start the clock)

  - This clocks in a predefined task by =org-id= that is the default task to clock in whenever the clock normally stops

- Clock in tasks normally, and let moving to a DONE state clock out

  - clocking out automatically clocks time on a parent task or moves back to the predefined default task if no parent exists.

- Continue clocking whatever tasks you work on
- Punch out (stop the clock)

I'm free to change the default task multiple times during the day but with the clock moving up the project tree on clock out I no longer need to do this. I simply have a single task that gets clocked in when I punch-in.

If I punch-in with a prefix on a task in =Project X= then that task automatically becomes the default task and all clocked time goes on that project until I either punch out or punch in some other task.

My org files look like this:

=todo.org=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   #+FILETAGS: PERSONAL
  ...
   * Tasks
   ** Organization
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL: today
      :ID:       eb155a82-92b2-4f25-a3c6-0304591af2f9
      :END:
     ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

If I am working on some task, then I simply clock in on the task. Clocking out moves the clock up to a parent task with a todo keyword (if any) which keeps the clock time in the same subtree. If there is no parent task with a todo keyword then the clock moves back to the default clocking task until I punch out or clock in some other task. When an interruption occurs I start a capture task which keeps clocked time on the interruption task until I close it with C-c C-c.

This works really well for me.

For example, consider the following org file:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   *  TODO  Project A
   **  NEXT  TASK 1
   **  TODO  TASK 2
   **  TODO  TASK 3
   * Tasks
   **  TODO  Some miscellaneous task
#+END_EXAMPLE

I'll work on this file in the following sequence:

1. I punch in with =F9-I= at the start of my day

   That clocks in the =Organization= task by id in my =todo.org= file.

2. =F12-SPC= to review my block agenda

   Pick 'TODO Some miscellaneous task' to work on next and clock that in with =I= The clock is now on 'TODO Some miscellaneous task'

3. I complete that task and mark it done with =C-c C-t d=

   This stops the clock and moves it back to the =Organization= task.

4. Now I want to work on =Project A= so I clock in =Task 1=

   I work on Task 1 and mark it =DONE=. This clocks out =Task 1= and moves the clock to =Project A=. Now I work on =Task 2= and clock that in.

The entire time I'm working on and clocking some subtask of =Project A= all of the clock time in the interval is applied somewhere to the =Project A= tree. When I eventually mark =Project A= done then the clock will move back to the default organization task.

****** <<sec-9-1>> 9.1 Clock Setup


To get started we need to punch in which clocks in the default task and keeps the clock running. This is now simply a matter of punching in the clock with =F9 I=. You can do this anywhere. Clocking out will now clock in the parent task (if there is one with a todo keyword) or clock in the default task if not parent exists.

Keeping the clock running when moving a subtask to a =DONE= state means clocking continues to apply to the project task. I can pick the next task from the parent and clock that in without losing a minute or two while I'm deciding what to work on next.

I keep clock times, state changes, and other notes in the =:LOGBOOK:= drawer.

I have the following org-mode settings for clocking:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-9-2>> 9.2 Clocking in


When I start or continue working on a task I clock it in with any of the following:

- =C-c C-x C-i=
- =I= in the agenda
- =I= speed key on the first character of the heading line
- =f9 I= while on the task in the agenda
- =f9 I= while in the task in an org file

******* <<sec-9-2-1>> 9.2.1 Setting a default clock task


I have a default =** Organization= task in my todo.org file that I tend to put miscellaneous clock time on. This is the task I clock in on when I punch in at the start of my work day with =F9-I=. While reorganizing my org-files, reading email, clearing my inbox, and doing other planning work that isn't for a specific project I'll clock in this task. Punching-in anywhere clocks in this Organization task as the default task.

If I want to change the default clocking task I just visit the new task in any org buffer and clock it in with =C-u C-u C-c C-x C-i=. Now this new task that collects miscellaneous clock minutes when the clock would normally stop.

You can quickly clock in the default clocking task with =C-u C-c C-x C-i d=. Another option is to repeatedly clock out so the clock moves up the project tree until you clock out the top-level task and the clock moves to the default task.

******* <<sec-9-2-2>> 9.2.2 Using the clock history to clock in old tasks


You can use the clock history to restart clocks on old tasks you've clocked or to jump directly to a task you have clocked previously. I use this mainly to clock in whatever got interrupted by something.

Consider the following scenario:

- You are working on and clocking =Task A= (Organization)
- You get interrupted and switch to =Task B= (Document my use of org-mode)
- You complete =Task B= (Document my use of org-mode)
- Now you want to go back to =Task A= (Organization) again to continue

This is easy to deal with.

1. Clock in =Task A=, work on it
2. Go to =Task B= (or create a new task) and clock it in
3. When you are finished with =Task B= hit =C-u C-c C-x C-i i=

This displays a clock history selection window like the following and selects the interrupted =[i]= entry.

*Clock history selection buffer for C-u C-c C-x C-i*

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Default Task
  [d] norang          Organization                          <-- Task B
  The task interrupted by starting the last one
  [i] norang          Organization                          <-- Task B
  Current Clocking Task
  [c] org             NEXT Document my use of org-mode      <-- Task A
  Recent Tasks
  [1] org             NEXT Document my use of org-mode      <-- Task A
  [2] norang          Organization                          <-- Task B
  ...
  [Z] org             DONE Fix default section links        <-- 35 clock task entries ago
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-9-3>> 9.3 Clock Everything - Create New Tasks


In order to clock everything you need a task for everything. That's fine for planned projects but interruptions inevitably occur and you need some place to record whatever time you spend on that interruption.

To deal with this we create a new capture task to record the thing we are about to do. The workflow goes something like this:

- You are clocking some task and an interruption occurs
- Create a quick capture task journal entry =C-c c j=
- Type the heading
- go do that thing (eat lunch, whatever)
- file it =C-c C-c=, this restores the clock back to the previous clocking task
- clock something else in or continue with the current clocking task

This means you can ignore the details like where this task really belongs in your org file layout and just get on with completing the thing. Refiling a bunch of tasks later in a group when it is convenient to refile the tasks saves time in the long run.

If it's a one-shot uninteresting task (like a coffee break) I create a capture journal entry for it that goes to the diary.org date tree. If it's a task that actually needs to be tracked and marked done, and applied to some project then I create a capture task instead which files it in refile.org.

****** <<sec-9-4>> 9.4 Finding tasks to clock in


To find a task to work on I use one of the following options (generally listed most frequently used first)

- Use the clock history C-u C-c C-x C-i Go back to something I was clocking that is not finished
- Pick something off today's block agenda =SCHEDULED= or =DEADLINE= items that need to be done soon
- Pick something off the =NEXT= tasks agenda view Work on some unfinished task to move to completion
- Pick something off the other task list
- Use an agenda view with filtering to pick something to work on

Punching in on the task you select will restrict the agenda view to that project so you can focus on just that thing for some period of time.

****** <<sec-9-5>> 9.5 Editing clock entries


Sometimes it is necessary to edit clock entries so they reflect reality. I find I do this for maybe 2-3 entries in a week.

Occassionally I cannot clock in a task on time because I'm away from my computer. In this case the previous clocked task is still running and counts time for both tasks which is wrong.

I make a note of the time and then when I get back to my computer I clock in the right task and edit the start and end times to correct the clock history.

To visit the clock line for an entry quickly use the agenda log mode. =F12 a l= shows all clock lines for today. I use this to navigate to the appropriate clock lines quickly. F11 goes to the current clocked task but the agenda log mode is better for finding and visiting older clock entries.

Use =F12 a l= to open the agenda in log mode and show only logged clock times. Move the cursor down to the clock line you need to edit and hit =TAB= and you're there.

To edit a clock entry just put the cursor on the part of the date you want to edit (use the keyboard not the mouse - since the clicking on the timestamp with the mouse goes back to the agenda for that day) and hit the =S-= or =S-= keys to change the time.

The following setting makes time editing use discrete minute intervals (no rounding) increments:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes (quote (1 1)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Editing the time with the shift arrow combination also updates the total for the clock line which is a nice convenience.

I always check that I haven't created task overlaps when fixing time clock entries by viewing them with log mode on in the agenda. There is a new view in the agenda for this -- just hit =v c= in the daily agenda and clock gaps and overlaps are identified.

I want my clock entries to be as accurate as possible.

The following setting shows 1 minute clocking gaps.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-agenda-clock-consistency-checks
        (quote ( :max-duration  "4:00"
                 :min-duration 0
                 :max-gap 0
                 :gap-ok-around ( "4:00"))))

****** <<sec-10-1>> 10.1 Billing clients based on clocked time


At the beginning of the month I invoice my clients for work done last month. This is where I review my clocking data for correctness before billing for the clocked time.

Billing for clocked time basically boils down to the following steps:

1. Verify that the clock data is complete and correct

2. Use clock reports to summarize time spent

3. Create an invoice based on the clock data

   I currently create invoices in an external software package based on the org-mode clock data.

4. Archive complete tasks so they are out of the way.

   See [[#Archiving][Archiving]] for more details.

******* <<sec-10-1-1>> 10.1.1 Verify that the clock data is complete and correct


Since I change tasks often (sometimes more than once in a minute) I use the following setting to remove clock entries with a zero duration.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Sometimes I change tasks I'm clocking quickly - this removes clocked tasks with 0:00 duration
  (setq org-clock-out-remove-zero-time-clocks t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This setting just keeps my clocked log entries clean - only keeping clock entries that contribute to the clock report.

Before invoicing for clocked time it is important to make sure your clocked time data is correct. If you have a clocked time with an entry that is not closed (ie. it has no end time) then that is a hole in your clocked day and it gets counted as zero (0) for time spent on the task when generating clock reports. Counting it as zero is almost certainly wrong.

To check for unclosed clock times I use the agenda-view clock check ( =v c= in the agenda). This view shows clocking gaps and overlaps in the agenda.

To check the last month's clock data I use =F12 a v m b v c= which shows a full month in the agenda, moves to the previous month, and shows the clocked times only. It's important to remove any agenda restriction locks and filters when checking the logs for gaps and overlaps.

The clocked-time only display in the agenda makes it easy to quickly scan down the list to see if an entry is missing an end time. If an entry is not closed you can manually fix the clock entry based on other clock info around that time.

******* <<sec-10-1-2>> 10.1.2 Using clock reports to summarize time spent


Billable time for clients are kept in separate org files.

To get a report of time spent on tasks for =XYZ.org= you simply visit the =XYZ.org= file and run an agenda clock report for the last month with =F12 < a v m b R=. This limits the agenda to this one file, shows the agenda for a full month, moves to last month, and generates a clock report.

My agenda org clock report settings show 5 levels of detail with links to the tasks. I like wider reports than the default compact setting so I override the =:narrow= value.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Agenda clock report parameters
  (setq org-agenda-clockreport-parameter-plist
        (quote ( :link t  :maxlevel 5  :fileskip0 t  :compact t  :narrow 80)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

I used to have a monthly clock report dynamic block in each project org file and manually updated them at the end of my billing cycle. I used this as the basis for billing my clients for time spent on their projects. I found updating the dynamic blocks fairly tedious when you have more than a couple of files for the month.

I have since moved to using agenda clock reports shortly after that feature was added. I find this much more convenient. The data isn't normally for consumption by anyone else so the format of the agenda clock report format is great for my use-case.

****** <<sec-10-2>> 10.2 Task Estimates and column view


Estimating how long tasks take to complete is a difficult skill to master. Org-mode makes it easy to practice creating estimates for tasks and then clock the actual time it takes to complete.

By repeatedly estimating tasks and reviewing how your estimate relates to the actual time clocked you can tune your estimating skills.

******* <<sec-10-2-1>> 10.2.1 Creating a task estimate with column mode


I use =properties= and =column view= to do project estimates.

I set up column view globally with the following headlines

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;  Set default column view headings: Task Effort Clock_Summary
  (setq org-columns-default-format  "%80ITEM(Task) %10Effort(Effort){:} %10CLOCKSUM")
#+END_EXAMPLE

This makes column view show estimated task effort and clocked times side-by-side which is great for reviewing your project estimates.

A property called =Effort= records the estimated amount of time a given task will take to complete. The estimate times I use are one of:

- 10 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 1 hour
- 2 hours
- 3 hours
- 4 hours
- 5 hours
- 6 hours
- 7 hours
- 8 hours

These are stored for easy use in =column mode= in the global property =Effort_ALL=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;  global Effort estimate values
   ;  global STYLE property values for completion
  (setq org-global-properties (quote (( "Effort_ALL" .  "0:15 0:30 0:45 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00 6:00 0:00")
                                      ( "STYLE_ALL" .  "habit"))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

To create an estimate for a task or subtree start column mode with =C-c C-x C-c= and collapse the tree with =c=. This shows a table overlayed on top of the headlines with the task name, effort estimate, and clocked time in columns.

With the cursor in the =Effort= column for a task you can easily set the estimated effort value with the quick keys =1= through =9=.

After setting the effort values exit =column mode= with =q=.

******* <<sec-10-2-2>> 10.2.2 Saving your estimate


For fixed price jobs where you provide your estimate to a client, then work to complete the project it is useful to save the original estimate that is provided to the client.

Save your original estimate by creating a dynamic clock report table at the top of your estimated project subtree. Entering =C-c C-x i RET= inserts a clock table report with your estimated values and any clocked time to date.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Original Estimate
   #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id local
   | Task                        | Estimated Effort | CLOCKSUM |
   |-----------------------------+------------------+----------|

I normally delete the =#+BEGIN:= and =#+END:= lines from the original table after providing the estimate to the client to ensure I don't accidentally update the table by hitting =C-c C-c= on the =#+BEGIN:= line.

Saving the original estimate data makes it possible to refine the project tasks into subtasks as you work on the project without losing the original estimate data.

******* <<sec-10-2-3>> 10.2.3 Reviewing your estimate


=Column view= is great for reviewing your estimate. This shows your estimated time value and the total clock time for the project side-by-side.

Creating a dynamic clock table with =C-c C-x i RET= is a great way to save this project review if you need to make it available to other applications.

=C-c C-x C-d= also provides a quick summary of clocked time for the current org file.

****** <<sec-10-3>> 10.3 Providing progress reports to others


When someone wants details of what I've done recently I simple generate a log report in the agenda with tasks I've completed and state changes combined with a clock report for the appropriate time period.

The following setting shows closed tasks and state changes in the agenda. Combined with the agenda clock report ('R') I can quickly generate all of the details required.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Agenda log mode items to display (closed and state changes by default)
  (setq org-agenda-log-mode-items (quote (closed state)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

To generate the report I pull up the agenda for the appropriate time frame (today, yesterday, this week, or last week) and hit the key sequence =l R= to add the log report (without clocking data lines) and the agenda clock report at the end.

Then it's simply a matter of exporting the resulting agenda in some useful format to provide to other people. =C-x C-w /tmp/agenda.html RET= exports to HTML and =C-x C-w /tmp/agenda.txt RET= exports to plain text. Other formats are available but I use these two the most.

Combining this export with tag filters and =C-u R= can limit the report to exactly the tags that people are interested in.

***** <<sec-11>> 11 Tags


Tasks can have any number of arbitrary tags. Tags are used for:

- filtering todo lists and agenda views
- providing context for tasks
- tagging notes
- tagging phone calls
- tagging meetings
- tagging tasks to be refiled
- tagging tasks in a WAITING state because a parent task is WAITING
- tagging cancelled tasks because a parent task is CANCELLED
- preventing export of some subtrees when publishing

I use tags mostly for filtering in the agenda. This means you can find tasks with a specific tag easily across your large number of org-mode files.

Some tags are mutually exclusive. These are defined in a group so that only one of the tags can be applied to a task at a time (disregarding tag inheritance). I use these types for tags for applying context to a task. (Work tasks have an =@office= tag, and are done at the office, Farm tasks have an =@farm= tag and are done at the farm -- I can't change the oil on the tractor if I'm not at the farm... so I hide these and other tasks by filtering my agenda view to only =@office= tasks when I'm at the office.)

Tasks are grouped together in org-files and a =#+FILETAGS:= entry applies a tag to all tasks in the file. I use this to apply a tag to all tasks in the file. My norang.org file creates a NORANG file tag so I can filter tasks in the agenda in the norang.org file easily.

****** <<sec-11-1>> 11.1 Tags


Here are my tag definitions with associated keys for filtering in the agenda views.

The startgroup - endgroup ( =@XXX=) tags are mutually exclusive - selecting one removes a similar tag already on the task. These are the context tags - you can't be in two places at once so if a task is marked with @farm and you add @office then the @farm tag is removed automagically.

The other tags =WAITING= .. =FLAGGED= are not mutually exclusive and multiple tags can appear on a single task. Some of those tags are created by todo state change triggers. The shortcut key is used to add or remove the tag using =C-c C-q= or to apply the task for filtering on the agenda.

I have both =FARM= and =@farm= tags. =FARM= is set by a =FILETAGS= entry and just gives me a way to filter anything farm related. The =@farm= tag signifies that the task as to be done /at the farm/. If I have to call someone about something that would have a =FARM= tag but I can do that at home on my lunch break. I don't physically have to be at the farm to make the call.

   ;  Tags with fast selection keys
  (setq org-tag-alist (quote (( :startgroup)

***** <<sec-12>> 12 Handling Notes


Notes are little gems of knowledge that you come across during your day. They are just like tasks except there is nothing to do (except learn and memorize the gem of knowledge). Unfortunately there are way too many gems to remember and my head explodes just thinking about it.

org-mode to the rescue!

Often I'll find some cool feature or thing I want to remember while reading the org-mode and git mailing lists in Gnus. To create a note I use my note capture template =C-c c n=, type a heading for the note and =C-c C-c= to save it. The only other thing to do is to refile it (later) to the appropriate project file.

I have an agenda view just to find notes. Notes are refiled to an appropriate project file and task. If there is no specific task it belongs to it goes to the catchall =* Notes= task. I generally have a catchall notes task in every project file. Notes are created with a =NOTE= tag already applied by the capture template so I'm free to refile the note anywhere. As long as the note is in a project file that contributes to my agenda (ie. in org-agenda-files) then I can find the note back easily with my notes agenda view by hitting the key combination =F12 N=. I'm free to limit the agenda view of notes using standard agenda tag filtering.

Short notes with a meaningful headline are a great way to remember technical details without the need to actually remember anything - other than how to find them back when you need them using =F12 N=.

Notes that are project related and not generally useful can be archived with the project and removed from the agenda when the project is removed.

So my org notes go in org.org and my git notes go in git.org both under the =* Notes= task. I'll forever be able to find those. A note about some work project detail I want to remember with the project is filed to the project task under the appropriate work org-mode file and eventually gets removed from the agenda when the project is complete and archived.

***** <<sec-13>> 13 Handling Phone Calls


Phone calls are interruptions and I use capture mode to deal with these (like all interruptions). Most of the heavy lifting for phone calls is done by capture mode. I use a special capture template for phone calls combined with a custom function that replaces text with information from my =bbdb= addressbook database.

=C-c c p= starts a capture task normally and I'm free to enter notes from the call in the template immediately. The cursor starts in the template normally where the name of the caller would be inserted. I can use a =bbdb= lookup function to insert the name with =f9-p= or I can just type in whatever is appropriate. If a =bbdb= entry needs to be created for the caller I can do that and replace the caller details with =f9-p= anytime that is convenient for me. I found that automatically calling the bbdb lookup function would interrupt my workflow during the call in cases where the information about the caller was not readily available. Sometimes I want to make notes first and get the caller details later during the call.

The phone call capture template starts the clock as soon as the phone rings and I'm free to lookup and replace the caller in bbdb anytime during or after the call. Capture mode starts the clock using the =:clock-in t= setting in the template.

When the phone call ends I simple do =C-c C-c= to close the capture buffer and stop the clock. If I have to close it early and look up other information during the call I just do =C-c C-c F9-SPC= to close the capture buffer (which stops the clock) and then immediately switch back to the last clocked item to continue the clock in the phone call task. When the phone call ends I clock out which normally clocks in my default task again (if any).

Here is my set up for phone calls. I would like to thank Gregory

1. Grubbs for the original bbdb lookup functions which this version

is based on.

Below is the partial capture template showing the phone call template followed by the phone-call related lookup functions.

***** <<sec-14>> 14 GTD stuff


Most of my day is deadline/schedule driven. I work off of the agenda first and then pick items from the todo lists as outlined in [[#WhatDoIWorkOnNext][What do I work on next?]]

****** <<sec-14-1>> 14.1 Weekly Review Process


The first day of the week (usually Monday) I do my weekly review. I keep a list like this one to remind me what needs to be done.

To keep the agenda fast I set

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-agenda-span 'day)
#+END_EXAMPLE

so only today's date is shown by default. I only need the weekly view during my weekly review and this keeps my agenda generation fast.

I have a recurring task which keeps my weekly review checklist handy. This pops up as a reminder on Monday's. This week I'm doing my weekly review on Tuesday since Monday was a holiday.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   *  NEXT  Weekly Review  [0/6]
     SCHEDULED:  <2009-05-18 Mon ++1w>
    :LOGBOOK:...
    :PROPERTIES:...

    What to review:

     -  [ ] Check follow-up folder
     -  [ ] Review weekly agenda  =F12 a w //=
     -  [ ] Check clocking data for past week  =v c=
     -  [ ] Review clock report for past week  =R=
       - Check where we spent time (too much or too little) and rectify this week
     -  [ ] Look at entire agenda for today   =F12 SPC=
     -  [ ] Review projects  =F12 SPC //= and  =V= repeatedly to view each project

     - start work
       - daily agenda first - knock off items
       - then work on NEXT tasks
#+END_EXAMPLE

The first item [ ] Check follow-up folder makes me pull out the paper file I dump stuff into all week long - things I need to take care of but are in no particular hurry to deal with. Stuff I get in the mail etc. that I don't want to deal with now. I just toss it in my =Follow-Up= folder in the filing cabinet and forget about it until the weekly review.

I go through the folder and weed out anything that needs to be dealt with. After that everything else is in =org-mode=. I tend to schedule tasks onto the agenda for the coming week so that I don't spend lots of time trying to find what needs to be worked on next.

This works for me. Your mileage may vary ;)

****** <<sec-14-2>> 14.2 Project definition and finding stuck projects


I'm using a new lazy project definition to mark tasks as projects. This requires zero effort from me. Any task with a subtask using a todo keyword is a project. Period.

Projects are 'stuck' if they have no subtask with a =NEXT= todo keyword task defined.

The org-mode stuck projects agenda view lists projects that have no =NEXT= task defined. Stuck projects show up on my block agenda and I tend to assign a =NEXT= task so the list remains empty. This helps to keep projects moving forward.

I disable the default org-mode stuck projects agenda view with the following setting.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-stuck-projects (quote ( "" nil nil  "")))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This prevents org-mode from trying to show incorrect data if I select the default stuck project view with =F12 #= from the agenda menu. My customized stuck projects view is part of my block agenda displayed with =F12 SPC=.

Projects can have subprojects - and these subprojects can also be stuck. Any project that is stuck shows up on the stuck projects list so I can indicate or create a =NEXT= task to move that project forward.

In the following example =Stuck Project A= is stuck because it has no subtask which is =NEXT=. =Project C= is not stuck because it has =NEXT= tasks =SubTask G= and =Task I=. =Stuck Sub Project D= is stuck because =SubTask E= is not =NEXT= and there are no other tasks available in this project.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   * Category
   **  TODO  Stuck Project A
   ***  TODO  Task B
   **  TODO  Project C
   ***  TODO  Stuck Sub Project D
   ****  TODO  SubTask E
   ***  TODO  Sub Project F
   ****  NEXT  SubTask G
   ****  TODO  SubTask H
   ***  NEXT  Task I
   ***  TODO  Task J
#+END_EXAMPLE

All of the stuck projects and subprojects show up in the stuck projects list and that is my indication to assign or create =NEXT= tasks until the stuck projects list is empty. Occasionally some subtask is =WAITING= for something and the project is stuck until that condition is satisfied. In this case I leave it on the stuck project list and just work on something else. This stuck project 'bugs' me regularly when I see it on the block agenda and this prompts me to follow up on the thing that I'm waiting for.

I have the following helper functions defined for projects which are used by agenda views.

***** <<sec-15>> 15 Archiving


****** <<sec-15-1>> 15.1 Archiving Subtrees


My archiving procedure has changed. I used to move entire subtrees to a separate archive file for the project. Task subtrees in =FILE.org= get archived to =FILE.org_archive= using the =a y= command in the agenda.

I still archive to the same archive file as before but now I archive any done state todo task that is old enough to archive. Tasks to archive are listed automatically at the end of my block agenda and these are guaranteed to be old enough that I've already billed any time associated with these tasks. This cleans up my project trees and removes the old tasks that are no longer interesting. The archived tasks get extra property data created during the archive procedure so that it is possible to reconstruct exactly where the archived entry came from in the rare case where you want to unarchive something.

My archive files are huge but so far I haven't found a need to split them by year (or decade) :)

Archivable tasks show up in the last section of my block agenda when a new month starts. Any tasks that are done but have no timestamps this month or last month (ie. they are over 30 days old) are available to archive. Timestamps include closed dates, notes, clock data, etc - any active or inactive timestamp in the task.

Archiving is trivial. Just mark all of the entries in the block agenda using the =m= key and then archive them all to the appropriate place with =B $=. This normally takes less than 5 minutes once a month.

****** <<sec-15-2>> 15.2 Archive Setup


I no longer use an =ARCHIVE= property in my subtrees. Tasks can just archive normally to the =Archived Tasks= heading in the archive file.

The following setting ensures that task states are untouched when they are archived. This makes it possible to archive tasks that are not marked =DONE=. By default tasks are archived under the heading =* Archived Tasks= in the archive file.

This archiving function does not keep your project trees intact. It archives done state tasks after they are old enough to they are removed from the main org file. It should be possible to reconstruct the original tree from the archive detail properties but I've never needed to do this yet. The archived detail is very useful the few times a year I actually need to look for some archived data but most of the time I just move it out of the way and keep it for historical purposes.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-archive-mark-done nil)
  (setq org-archive-location  "%s_archive::* Archived Tasks")
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ( defun  bh/skip-non-archivable-tasks ()
     "Skip trees that are not available for archiving"
    ( save-restriction
      (widen)
       ;;  Consider only tasks with done todo headings as archivable candidates
      ( let ((next-headline ( save-excursion (or (outline-next-heading) (point-max))))

#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-15-3>> 15.3 Archive Tag - Hiding Information


The only time I set the ARCHIVE tag on a task is to prevent it from opening by default because it has tons of information I don't really need to look at on a regular basis. I can open the task with C-TAB if I need to see the gory details (like a huge table of data related to the task) but normally I don't need that information displayed.

****** <<sec-15-4>> 15.4 When to Archive


Archiving monthly works well for me. I keep completed tasks around for at least 30 days before archiving them. This keeps current clocking information for the last 30 days out of the archives. This keeps my files that contribute to the agenda fairly current (this month, and last month, and anything that is unfinished). I only rarely visit tasks in the archive when I need to pull up ancient history for something.

Archiving keeps my main working files clutter-free. If I ever need the detail for the archived tasks they are available in the appropriate archive file.

***** <<sec-16>> 16 Publishing and Exporting


I don't do a lot of publishing for other people but I do keep a set of private client system documentation online. Most of this documentation is a collection of notes exported to HTML.

Everything at [[http://doc.norang.ca/]] is generated by publishing org-files. This includes the index pages on this site.

Org-mode can export to a variety of publishing formats including (but not limited to)

- ASCII (plain text - but not the original org-mode file)
- HTML
- LaTeX
- Docbook which enables getting to lots of other formats like ODF, XML, etc
- PDF via LaTeX or Docbook
- iCal

I haven't begun the scratch the surface of what org-mode is capable of doing. My main use case for org-mode publishing is just to create HTML documents for viewing online conveniently. Someday I'll get time to try out the other formats when I need them for something.

****** 16.1 New Exporter Setup


The new exporter created by Nicolas Goaziou was introduced in org 8.0.

I have the following setup for the exporters I use.

Alphabetical listing options need to be set before the exporters are loaded for filling to work correctly.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-alphabetical-lists t)

   ;;  Explicitly load required exporters
  ( require ' ox-html)
  ( require ' ox-latex)
  ( require ' ox-ascii)
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* 16.1.1 Conversion from the old exporter to the new exporter


Here is the list of changes I made to move from the old exporter (pre org 8.0) to the new exporter.

- Explicitly require exporters

  - Add =ox-html=
  - Add =ox-latex=
  - Add =ox-ascii=

- Rename variables

  - =org-export-html-style-extra= to =org-html-head-extra=
  - =org-export-html-validation-link= to =org-html-validation-link=
  - =org-export-html-inline-images= to =org-html-inline-images=
  - =org-export-html-style-include-default= to =org-html-head-include-default-style=
  - =org-export-html-xml-declaration= to =org-html-xml-declaration=
  - =org-export-latex-listings= to =org-latex-listings=
  - =org-export-html-style-include-scripts= to =org-html-head-include-scripts=

- Publishing changes

  - Rename =:publishing-function=

    - =org-publish-org-to-html= to =org-html-publish-to-html=
    - =org-publish-org-to-org= to =org-org-publish-to-org=

  - Change =:style= to =:html-head=

- Change =bh/is-late-deadline= to handle modified deadline string in agenda

- Reverse agenda sorting for late deadlines

  These are no longer reported with negative values on the agenda

- Add a blank line after my inactive timestamps following headings to prevent them from being exported.

****** <<sec-16-2>> 16.2 Org-babel Setup


Org-babel makes it easy to generate decent graphics using external packages like ditaa, graphviz, PlantUML, and others.

The setup is really easy. =ditaa= is provided with the org-mode source. You'll have to install the =graphviz= and =PlantUML= packages on your system.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-ditaa-jar-path  "~/git/org-mode/contrib/scripts/ditaa.jar")
  (setq org-plantuml-jar-path  "~/java/plantuml.jar")

  (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'bh/display-inline-images 'append)

   ;  Make babel results blocks lowercase
  (setq org-babel-results-keyword  "results")

  ( defun  bh/display-inline-images ()
    ( condition-case nil
        (org-display-inline-images)
      ( error nil)))

  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   (quote org-babel-load-languages)
   (quote ((emacs-lisp . t)
           (dot . t)
           (ditaa . t)
           (R . t)
           (python . t)
           (ruby . t)
           (gnuplot . t)
           (clojure . t)
           (sh . t)
           (ledger . t)
           (org . t)
           (plantuml . t)
           (latex . t))))

   ;  Do not prompt to confirm evaluation
   ;  This may be dangerous - make sure you understand the consequences
   ;  of setting this -- see the docstring for details
  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)

   ;  Use fundamental mode when editing plantuml blocks with C-c '
  (add-to-list 'org-src-lang-modes (quote ( "plantuml" . fundamental)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now you just create a =begin-src= block for the appropriate tool, edit the text, and build the pictures with =C-c C-c=. After evaluating the block results are displayed. You can toggle display of inline images with =C-c C-x C-v=

I disable startup with inline images because when I access my org-files from an SSH session without X this breaks (say from my Android phone) it fails when trying to display the images on a non-X session. It's much more important for me to be able to access my org files from my Android phone remotely than it is to see images on startup.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Don't enable this because it breaks access to emacs from my Android phone
  (setq org-startup-with-inline-images nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-16-3>> 16.3 Playing with ditaa


[[http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/][ditaa]] is a great tool for quickly generating graphics to convey ideas and =ditaa= is distributed with org-mode! All of the graphics in this document are automatically generated by org-mode using plain text source.

Artist mode makes it easy to create boxes and lines for ditaa graphics.

The source for a ditaa graphic looks like this in org-mode:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   #+begin_src ditaa :file some_filename.png :cmdline -r -s 0.8

   #+end_src
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here's an example without the =#+begin_src= and =#+end_src= lines.

   #+end_src

The =-Kdot= is optional (defaults to =dot=) but you can substitute other graphviz types instead here (ie. =twopi=, =neato=, =circo=, etc).

****** <<sec-16-6>> 16.6 Publishing Single Files


Org-mode exports the current file to one of the standard formats by invoking an export function. The standard key binding for this is =C-c C-e= followed by the key for the type of export you want.

This works great for single files or parts of files -- if you narrow the buffer to only part of the org-mode file then you only get the narrowed detail in the export.

****** <<sec-16-7>> 16.7 Publishing Projects


I mainly use publishing for publishing multiple files or projects. I don't want to remember where the created export file needs to move to and org-mode projects are a great solution to this.

The [[http://doc.norang.ca]] website (and a bunch of other files that are not publicly available) are all created by editing org-mode files and publishing the project the file is contained in. This is great for people like me who want to figure out the details once and forget about it. I love stuff that Just Works(tm).

I have 5 main projects I use org-mode publishing for currently:

- norang (website)
- doc.norang.ca (website, published documents)
- doc.norang.ca/private (website, non-published documents)
- www.norang.ca/tmp (temporary publishing site for testing org-mode stuff)
- org files (which are selectively included by other websites)

Here's my publishing setup:

#+END_EXAMPLE

The main projects are =norang=, =doc=, =doc-private=, =org-mode-doc=, and =tmp=. These projects publish directly to the webserver directory on a remote web server that serves the site. Publishing one of these projects exports all modified pages, generates images, and copies the resulting files to the webserver so that they are immediately available for viewing.

The [[http://doc.norang.ca/]] site contains subdirectories with client and private documentation that are restricted by using Apache Basic authentication. I don't create links to these sites from the publicly viewable pages. [[http://doc.norang.ca/someclient/]] would show the index for any org files under =~/git/doc.norang.ca/someclient/= if that is set up as a viewable website. I use most of the information myself but give access to clients if they are interested in the information/notes that I keep about their systems.

This works great for me - I know where my notes are and I can access them from anywhere on the internet. I'm also free to share notes with other people by simply giving them the link to the appropriate site.

All I need to remember to do is edit the appropriate org file and publish it with C-S-F12 -- not exactly hard :)

I added a temporary publishing site for testing exports and validation. This is the =tmp= site which takes files from =/tmp/publish= and exports those files to a website publishing directory. This makes it easy to try new throw-away things on a live server.

****** <<sec-16-8>> 16.8 Miscellaneous Export Settings


This is a collection of export and publishing related settings that I use.

******* <<sec-16-8-1>> 16.8.1 Fontify Latex listings for source blocks


For export to latex I use the following setting to get fontified listings from source blocks:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-latex-listings t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* <<sec-16-8-2>> 16.8.2 Export HTML without XML header


I use the following setting to remove the xml header line for HTML exports. This xml line was confusing Open Office when opening the HTML to convert to ODT.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-html-xml-declaration (quote (( "html" .  "")
                                         ( "was-html" .  "")
                                         ( "php" .  "\"; ?>"))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* <<sec-16-8-3>> 16.8.3 Allow binding variables on export without confirmation


The following setting allows #+BIND: variables to be set on export without confirmation. In rare situations where I want to override some org-mode variable for export this allows exporting the document without a prompt.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-export-allow-BIND t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** <<sec-17>> 17 Reminders


I use appt for reminders. It's simple and unobtrusive -- putting pending appointments in the status bar and beeping as 12, 9, 6, 3, and 0 minutes before the appointment is due.

Everytime the agenda is displayed (and that's lots for me) the appointment list is erased and rebuilt from the current agenda details for today. This means everytime I reschedule something, add or remove tasks that are time related the appointment list is automatically updated the next time I look at the agenda.

****** <<sec-17-1>> 17.1 Reminder Setup


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;  Erase all reminders and rebuilt reminders for today from the agenda
  ( defun  bh/org-agenda-to-appt ()
    (interactive)
    (setq appt-time-msg-list nil)
    (org-agenda-to-appt))

   ;  Rebuild the reminders everytime the agenda is displayed
  (add-hook 'org-agenda-finalize-hook 'bh/org-agenda-to-appt 'append)

   ;  This is at the end of my .emacs - so appointments are set up when Emacs starts
  (bh/org-agenda-to-appt)

   ;  Activate appointments so we get notifications
  (appt-activate t)

   ;  If we leave Emacs running overnight - reset the appointments one minute after midnight
  (run-at-time  "24:01" nil 'bh/org-agenda-to-appt)
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** <<sec-18>> 18 Productivity Tools


This section is a miscellaneous collection of Emacs customizations that I use with org-mode so that it Works-For-Me(tm).

****** <<sec-18-1>> 18.1 Abbrev-mode and Skeletons


I use skeletons with abbrev-mode to quickly add preconfigured blocks to my Emacs edit buffers.

I have blocks for creating:

- generic blocks in org-mode
- plantuml blocks in org-mode

  - plantuml activity diagram block in org-mode
  - plantuml sequence diagram block in org-mode

- graphviz dot blocks in org-mode
- ditaa blocks in org-mode
- elisp source blocks in org-mode

I still use =< e TAB= and =< s TAB= for creating example blocks and simple shell script blocks that need no further parameters.

Here's my current setup for org-mode related skeletons. Each one defines an abbrev-mode shortcut so I can type =splantumlRET= to create a Plantuml block. This prompts for the filename (without extension) for the generated image file.

At work I add a =:tangle= header to the skeleton and explicitly include the =@startuml= and =@enduml= marker lines in the skeleton so I can tangle the source file and share it with my colleagues. This makes the tangled source useable in Notepad and the =PlantUML= jar file running standalone.

I have put the =s= (src) prefix on the shortcuts to prevent abbrev-mode from trying to expand =PlantUML= when I'm typing it in a sentence.

For convenience in activity diagrams I added =sif= and =sfor= and just change the labels for the synchronization bars.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Enable abbrev-mode
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook ( lambda () (abbrev-mode 1)))

   ;;  Skeletons
   ;;

I also use abbrev-mode when taking notes at work. I tend to write first names for people which get expanded to their complete name in my notes. So if I write =mickey= it gets automatically expanded to =Mickey Mouse= as I type. To create an abbreviation just type in the short form followed by =C-x a i l= to create an abbreviation for the current mode I'm in.

The only thing you have to be careful with is not to use a common word for your abbreviation since abbrev-mode will try to expand it everytime you enter it. I found this annoying when I used =plantuml= as one of my abbreviations.

I also use skeletons and abbrev-mode for C source files at work. This works really well for me.

There is more than one way to do this. Use what works for you.

******* <<sec-18-2-1>> 18.2.1 Narrowing to a subtree with =bh/org-todo=


=f5= and =S-f5= are bound the functions for narrowing and widening the emacs buffer as defined below.

We now use:

- T (tasks) for C-c / t on the current buffer
- N (narrow) narrows to this task subtree
- U (up) narrows to the immediate parent task subtree without moving
- P (project) narrows to the parent project subtree without moving
- F (file) narrows to the current file or file of the existing restriction

The agenda keeps widening the org buffer so this gives a convenient way to focus on what we are doing.

This makes it easy to hide all of the other details in your org-file temporarily by limiting your view to this task subtree. Tasks are folded and hilighted so that only tasks which are incomplete are shown.

I hit =f5= (or the =T= speed key) a lot. This basically does a =org-narrow-to-subtree= and =C-c / t= combination leaving the buffer in a narrowed state. I use =S-f5= (or some other widening speed key like =U=, =W=, =F=) to widen back to the normal view.

I also have the following setting to force showing the next headline.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-show-entry-below (quote ((default))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This prevents too many headlines from being folded together when I'm working with collapsed trees.

******* <<sec-18-2-2>> 18.2.2 Limiting the agenda to a subtree


=C-c C-x <= turns on the agenda restriction lock for the current subtree. This keeps your agenda focused on only this subtree. Alarms and notifications are still active outside the agenda restriction. =C-c C-x >= turns off the agenda restriction lock returning your agenda view back to normal.

I have added key bindings for the agenda to allow using =C-c C-x <= in the agenda to set the restriction lock to the current task directly. The following elisp accomplishes this.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (add-hook 'org-agenda-mode-hook
            '( lambda () (org-defkey org-agenda-mode-map  "\C-c\C-x<" 'bh/set-agenda-restriction-lock))
            'append)

  ( defun  bh/set-agenda-restriction-lock (arg)
     "Set restriction lock to current task subtree or file if prefix is specified"
    (interactive  "p")
    ( let* ((pom (bh/get-pom-from-agenda-restriction-or-point))
           (tags (org-with-point-at pom (org-get-tags-at))))
      ( let ((restriction-type ( if (equal arg 4) 'file 'subtree)))
        ( save-restriction
          ( cond
           ((and (equal major-mode 'org-agenda-mode) pom)
            (org-with-point-at pom
              (org-agenda-set-restriction-lock restriction-type))
            (org-agenda-redo))
           ((and (equal major-mode 'org-mode) (org-before-first-heading-p))
            (org-agenda-set-restriction-lock 'file))
           (pom
            (org-with-point-at pom
              (org-agenda-set-restriction-lock restriction-type))))))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This allows me to set the restriction lock from agenda to task directly. I work from the agenda a lot and I find this very convenient.

Setting the restriction directly to the task is less surprising than automatically moving up the tree to the project level task -- which is what I was doing before. If the select task is too restrictive it's easy to move the restriction lock up a level by visiting the task in the org file and going up and resetting the lock - in case you want to see move of the project.

Selecting the entire project sometimes has too many tasks in it and I want to limit the view to part of the subtree. This is why I keep the =N= and =U= key bindings for adjusting the narrowed region.

I've added new convenience keys for restricting the agenda and org-buffer to subtree, parent task, and project task, as well as removing the restriction. These keys work both in the agenda and as speed commands on a headline in the org-file.

- =N= narrows to the current task subtree

  This is the same as same as =C-c C-x <=

- =U= narrows to the parent subtree of this task

  This goes up one level and narrows to that subtree.

- =P= narrows to the entire project containing this task

  This goes up the tree to the top-level =TODO= keyword and selects that as the subtree to narrow to

- =W= removes the restriction, widening the buffer

I like the highlighting for a restriction to only affect the headline and not the entire body of the agenda restriction. I use the following setting to keep the highlight on the heading only (as was the case for pre-8.0 versions of org-mode)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Limit restriction lock highlighting to the headline only
  (setq org-agenda-restriction-lock-highlight-subtree nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* <<sec-18-2-3>> 18.2.3 Limiting the agenda to a file


You can limit the agenda view to a single file in multiple ways.

You can use the agenda restriction lock =C-c C-x <= on the any line before the first heading to set the agenda restriction lock to this file only. This is equivalent using a prefix argumment ( =C-u C-c C-x <=) anywhere in the file. This lock stays in effect until you remove it with =C-c C-x >=.

This also works in the agenda with my =C-u C-c c-x <= key binding.

Another way is to invoke the agenda with =F12 < a= while visiting an org-mode file. This limits the agenda view to just this file. I occasionally use this to view a file not in my =org-agenda-files= in the agenda.

****** <<sec-18-3>> 18.3 Tuning the Agenda Views


Various customizations affect how the agenda views show task details. This section shows each of the customizations I use in my workflow.

******* <<sec-18-3-1>> 18.3.1 Highlight the current agenda line


The following code in my =.emacs= file keeps the current agenda line highlighted. This makes it obvious what task will be affected by commands issued in the agenda. No more acting on the wrong task by mistake!

The clock modeline time is also shown with a reverse background.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Always hilight the current agenda line

     ;;  If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
     ;;  Your init file should contain only one such instance.
     ;;  If there is more than one, they won't work right.
   '(org-mode-line-clock ((t ( :background  "grey75"  :foreground  "red"  :box ( :line-width -1  :style released-button)))) t))
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* <<sec-18-3-2>> 18.3.2 Keep tasks with timestamps visible on the global todo lists


Tasks with dates ( =SCHEDULED:=, =DEADLINE:=, or active dates) show up in the agenda when appropriate. The block agenda view ( =F12 a=) tries to keep tasks showing up only in one location (either in the calendar or other todo lists in later sections of the block agenda.) I now rarely use the global todo list search in org-mode ( =F12 t=, =F12 m=) and when I do I'm trying to find a specific task quickly. These lists now include everything so I can just search for the item I want and move on.

The block agenda prevents display of tasks with deadlines or scheduled dates in the future so you can safely ignore these until the appropriate time.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Keep tasks with dates on the global todo lists
  (setq org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date nil)

   ;;  Keep tasks with deadlines on the global todo lists
  (setq org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines nil)

   ;;  Keep tasks with scheduled dates on the global todo lists
  (setq org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled nil)

   ;;  Keep tasks with timestamps on the global todo lists
  (setq org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp nil)

   ;;  Remove completed deadline tasks from the agenda view
  (setq org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t)

   ;;  Remove completed scheduled tasks from the agenda view
  (setq org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t)

   ;;  Remove completed items from search results
  (setq org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-done t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* <<sec-18-3-3>> 18.3.3 Use the Diary for Holidays and Appointments


I don't use the emacs Diary for anything but I like seeing the holidays on my agenda. This helps with planning for those days when you're not supposed to be working.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-agenda-include-diary nil)
  (setq org-agenda-diary-file  "~/git/org/diary.org")
#+END_EXAMPLE

The diary file keeps =date-tree= entries created by the capture mode 'appointment' template. I use this also for miscellaneous tasks I want to clock during interruptions.

I don't use a =~/diary= file anymore. That is just there as a zero-length file to keep Emacs happy. I use org-mode's diary functions instead. Inserting entries with =i= in the emacs agenda creates date entries in the =~/git/org/diary.org= file.

I include holidays from the calendar in my =todo.org= file as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   #+FILETAGS: PERSONAL
   * Appointments
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CATEGORY: Appt
     :ARCHIVE:  %s_archive::* Appointments
     :END:
   ** Holidays
      :PROPERTIES:
      :Category: Holiday
      :END:
     %%(org-calendar-holiday)
   ** Some other Appointment
     ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

I use the following setting so any time strings in the heading are shown in the agenda.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-agenda-insert-diary-extract-time t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* <<sec-18-3-4>> 18.3.4 Searches include archive files


I keep a single archive file for each of my org-mode project files. This allows me to search the current file and the archive when I need to dig up old information from the archives.

I don't need this often but it sure is handy on the occasions that I do need it.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Include agenda archive files when searching for things
  (setq org-agenda-text-search-extra-files (quote (agenda-archives)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* <<sec-18-3-5>> 18.3.5 Agenda view tweaks


The following agenda customizations control

- display of repeating tasks
- display of empty dates on the agenda
- task sort order
- start the agenda weekly view with Sunday
- display of the grid
- habits at the bottom

I use a custom sorting function so that my daily agenda lists tasks in order of importance. Tasks on the daily agenda are listed in the following order:

1. tasks with times at the top so they are hard to miss
2. entries for today (active timestamp headlines that are not scheduled or deadline tasks)
3. deadlines due today
4. late deadline tasks
5. scheduled items for today
6. pending deadlines (due soon)
7. late scheduled items
8. habits

The lisp for this isn't particularly pretty but it works.

******* <<sec-18-3-6>> 18.3.6 Sticky Agendas


Sticky agendas allow you to have more than one agenda view created simultaneously. You can quickly switch to the view without incurring an agenda rebuild by invoking the agenda custom command key that normally generates the agenda. If it already exists it will display the existing view. =g= forces regeneration of the agenda view.

I normally have two views displayed ( =F12 a= for the daily/weekly agenda and =F12 SPC= for my project management view)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Use sticky agenda's so they persist
  (setq org-agenda-sticky t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-4>> 18.4 Checklist handling


Checklists are great for repeated tasks with lots of things that need to be done. For a long time I was manually resetting the check boxes to unchecked when marking the repeated task =DONE= but no more! There's a contributed =org-checklist= that can uncheck the boxes automagically when the task is marked done.

Add the following to your =.emacs=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name  "~/git/org-mode/contrib/lisp"))

  ( require ' org-checklist)
#+END_EXAMPLE

and then to use it in a task you simply set the property =RESET_CHECK_BOXES= to =t= like this

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   *  TODO  Invoicing and Archive Tasks  [0/7]
     DEADLINE:  <2009-07-01 Wed +1m -0d>
     :PROPERTIES:
     :RESET_CHECK_BOXES: t
     :END:

    -  [ ] Do task 1
    -  [ ] Do task 2
    ...
    -  [ ] Do task 7
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-5>> 18.5 Backups


=Backups that you have to work hard at don't get done=.

I lost a bunch of data over 10 years ago due to not having a working backup solution. At the time I said =I'm not going to lose any important data ever again=. So far so good :)

My backups get done religiously. What does this have to do with org-mode? Not much really, other than I don't spend time doing backups -- they just happen -- which saves me time for other more interesting things.

My backup philosophy is to make it possible to recover your data -- not necessarily easy. It doesn't have to be easy/fast to do the recovery because I'll rarely have to recover data from the backups. Saving time for recovery doesn't make sense to me. I want the backup to be fast and painless since I do those all the time.

I set up an automated network backup over 10 years ago that is still serving me well today. All of my systems gets daily backups to a network drive. These are collected monthly and written to an external removable USB disk.

Once a month my task for backups prompts me to move the current collection of montly backups to the USB drive for external storage. Backups take minimal effort currently and I'm really happy about that.

Since then =git= came into my life, so backups of =git= repositories that are on multiple machines is much less critical than it used to be. There is an automatic backup of everything pushed to the remote repository.

****** <<sec-18-6>> 18.6 Handling blocked tasks


Blocked tasks are tasks that have subtasks which are not in a done todo state. Blocked tasks show up in a grayed font by default in the agenda.

To enable task blocking set the following variable:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-enforce-todo-dependencies t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This setting prevents tasks from changing to =DONE= if any subtasks are still open. This works pretty well except for repeating tasks. I find I'm regularly adding =TODO= tasks under repeating tasks and not all of the subtasks need to be complete before the next repeat cycle.

You can override the setting temporarily by changing the task with =C-u C-u C-u C-c C-t= but I never remember that. I set a permanent property on the repeated tasks as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   *  TODO  New Repeating Task
     SCHEDULED:  <2009-06-16 Tue +1w>
     :PROPERTIES:
     :NOBLOCKING: t
     :END:
    ...
   **  TODO  Subtask
#+END_EXAMPLE

This prevents the =New Repeating Task= from being blocked if some of the items under it are not complete.

Occassionally I need to complete tasks in a given order. Org-mode has a property =ORDERED= that enforces this for subtasks.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   *  TODO  Some Task
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ORDERED: t
     :END:
   **  TODO  Step 1
   **  TODO  Step 2
   **  TODO  Step 3
#+END_EXAMPLE

In this case you need to complete =Step 1= before you can complete =Step 2=, etc. and org-mode prevents the state change to a done task until the preceding tasks are complete.

****** <<sec-18-7>> 18.7 Org Task structure and presentation


This section describes various org-mode settings I use to control how tasks are displayed while I work on my org mode files.

******* <<sec-18-7-1>> 18.7.1 Controlling display of leading stars on headlines


Org-mode has the ability to show or hide the leading stars on task headlines. It's also possible to have headlines at odd levels only so that the stars and heading task names line up in sublevels.

To make org show leading stars use

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-hide-leading-stars nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

I now use org-indent mode which hides leading stars.

******* <<sec-18-7-2>> 18.7.2 org-indent mode


I recently started using org-indent mode. I like this setting a lot. It removes the indentation in the org-file but displays it as if it was indented while you are working on the org file buffer.

org-indent mode displays as if org-odd-levels-only is true but it has a really clean look that I prefer over my old setup.

I have org-indent mode on by default at startup with the following setting:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-startup-indented t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* <<sec-18-7-3>> 18.7.3 Handling blank lines


Blank lines are evil :). They keep getting inserted in between headlines and I don't want to see them in collapsed (contents) views. When I use =TAB= to fold (cycle) tasks I don't want to see any blank lines between headings.

The following setting hides blank lines between headings which keeps folded view nice and compact.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-cycle-separator-lines 0)
#+END_EXAMPLE

I find extra blank lines in lists and headings a bit of a nuisance. To get a body after a list you need to include a blank line between the list entry and the body -- and indent the body appropriately. Most of my lists have no body detail so I like the look of collapsed lists with no blank lines better.

The following setting prevents creating blank lines before headings but allows list items to adapt to existing blank lines around the items:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-blank-before-new-entry (quote ((heading)
                                           (plain-list-item . auto))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* <<sec-18-7-4>> 18.7.4 Adding new tasks quickly without disturbing the current task content


To create new headings in a project file it is really convenient to use =C-RET=, =C-S-RET=, =M-RET=, and =M-S-RET=. This inserts a new headline possibly with a =TODO= keyword. With the following setting

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-insert-heading-respect-content nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

org inserts the heading at point for the =M-= versions and respects content for the =C-= versions. The respect content setting is temporarily turned on for the =C-= versions which adds the new heading after the content of the current item. This lets you hit =C-S-RET= in the middle of an entry and the new heading is added after the body of the current entry but still allow you to split an entry in the middle with =M-S-RET=.

******* <<sec-18-7-5>> 18.7.5 Notes at the top


I enter notes for tasks with =C-c C-z= (or just =z= in the agenda). Changing tasks states also sometimes prompt for a note (e.g. moving to =WAITING= prompts for a note and I enter a reason for why it is waiting). These notes are saved at the top of the task so unfolding the task shows the note first.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-reverse-note-order nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* <<sec-18-7-6>> 18.7.6 Searching and showing results


Org-mode's searching capabilities are really effective at finding data in your org files. =C-c / /= does a regular expression search on the current file and shows matching results in a collapsed view of the org-file.

I have org-mode show the hierarchy of tasks above the matched entries and also the immediately following sibling task (but not all siblings) with the following settings:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-show-following-heading t)
  (setq org-show-hierarchy-above t)
  (setq org-show-siblings (quote ((default))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This keeps the results of the search relatively compact and mitigates accidental errors by cutting too much data from your org file with =C-k=. Cutting folded data (including the ...) can be really dangerous since it cuts text (including following subtrees) which you can't see. For this reason I always show the following headline when displaying search results.

******* <<sec-18-7-7>> 18.7.7 Editing and Special key handling


Org-mode allows special handling of the C-a, C-e, and C-k keys while editing headlines. I also use the setting that pastes (yanks) subtrees and adjusts the levels to match the task I am pasting to. See the docstring ( =C-h v org-yank-adjust-subtrees=) for more details on each variable and what it does.

I have =org-special-ctrl-a/e= set to enable easy access to the beginning and end of headlines. I use =M-m= or =C-a C-a= to get to the beginning of the line so the speed commands work and =C-a= to give easy access to the beginning of the heading text when I need that.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-special-ctrl-a/e t)
  (setq org-special-ctrl-k t)
  (setq org-yank-adjusted-subtrees t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-8>> 18.8 Attachments


Attachments are great for getting large amounts of data related to your project out of your org-mode files. Before attachments came along I was including huge blocks of SQL code in my org files to keep track of changes I made to project databases. This bloated my org file sizes badly.

Now I can create the data in a separate file and attach it to my project task so it's easily located again in the future.

I set up org-mode to generate unique attachment IDs with =org-id-method= as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-id-method (quote uuidgen))
#+END_EXAMPLE

Say you want to attach a file =x.sql= to your current task. Create the file data in =/tmp/x.sql= and save it.

Attach the file with =C-c C-a a= and enter the filename: =x.sql=. This generates a unique ID for the task and adds the file in the attachment directory.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   * Attachments                                                         :ATTACH:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :Attachments: x.sql
     :ID:       f1d38e9a-ff70-4cc4-ab50-e8b58b2aaa7b
     :END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

The attached file is saved in =data/f1/d38e9a-ff70-4cc4-ab50-e8b58b2aaa7b/=. Where it goes exactly isn't important for me -- as long as it is saved and retrievable easily. Org-mode copies the original file =/tmp/x.sql= into the appropriate attachment directory.

Tasks with attachments automatically get an =ATTACH= tag so you can easily find tasks with attachments with a tag search.

To open the attachment for a task use =C-c C-a o=. This prompts for the attachment to open and =TAB= completion works here.

The =ID= changes for every task header when a new =ID= is generated.

It's possible to use named directories for attachments but I haven't needed this functionality yet -- it's there if you need it.

I store my org-mode attachments with my org files in a subdirectory =data=. These are automatically added to my =git= repository along with any other org-mode changes I've made.

****** <<sec-18-9>> 18.9 Deadlines and Agenda Visibility


Deadlines and due dates are a fact or life. By default I want to see deadlines in the agenda 30 days before the due date.

The following setting accomplishes this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-deadline-warning-days 30)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This gives me plenty of time to deal with the task so that it is completed on or before the due date.

I also use deadlines for repeating tasks. If the task repeats more often than once per month it would be always bugging me on the agenda view. For these types of tasks I set an explicit deadline warning date as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   *  TODO  Pay Wages
     DEADLINE:  <2009-07-01 Wed +1m -0d>
#+END_EXAMPLE

This example repeats monthly and shows up in the agenda on the day it is due (with no prior warning). You can set any number of lead days you want on DEADLINES using -Nd where N is the number of days in advance the task should show up in the agenda. If no value is specified the default =org-deadline-warning-days= is used.

****** <<sec-18-10>> 18.10 Exporting Tables to CSV


I generate org-mode tables with details of task specifications and record structures for some of my projects. My clients like to use spreadsheets for this type of detail.

It's easy to share the details of the org-mode table by exporting in HTML but that isn't easy for anyone else to work with if they need to edit data.

To solve this problem I export my table as comma delimited values (CSV) and then send that to the client (or read it into a spreadsheet and email the resulting spreadsheet file).

Org-mode can export tables as TAB or comma delimited formats. I set the default format to CSV with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-table-export-default-format  "orgtbl-to-csv")
#+END_EXAMPLE

Exporting to CSV format is the only one I use and this provides the default so I can just hit RETURN when prompted for the format.

To export the following table I put the cursor inside the table and hit =M-x org-table-export= which prompts for a filename and the format which defaults to orgtbl-to-csv from the setting above.

| One   | Two    | Three |
|-------+--------+-------|
| 1     | 1      | 2     |
| 3     | 6      | 5     |
| fred  | kpe    | mary  |
| 234.5 | 432.12 | 324.3 |

This creates the file with the following data

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  One ,Two ,Three
  1 ,1 ,2
  3 ,6 ,5
  fred ,kpe ,mary
  234.5 ,432.12 ,324.3
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-11>> 18.11 Minimize Emacs Frames


Links to emails, web pages, and other files are sprinkled all over my org files. The following setting control how org-mode handles opening the link.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-link-frame-setup (quote ((vm . vm-visit-folder)
                                     (gnus . org-gnus-no-new-news)
                                     (file . find-file))))

   ;  Use the current window for C-c ' source editing
  (setq org-src-window-setup 'current-window)
#+END_EXAMPLE

I like to keep links in the same window so that I don't end up with a ton of frames in my window manager. I normally work in a full-screen window and having links open in the same window just works better for me.

If I need to work in multiple files I'll manually create the second frame with =C-x 5 2= or split the window with =C-x 4 2= or =C-X 4 3=. When I visit files in Emacs I normally want to replace the current window with the new content.

****** <<sec-18-12>> 18.12 Logging stuff


Most of my logging is controlled by the global =org-todo-keywords=

My logging settings are set as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-log-done (quote time))
  (setq org-log-into-drawer t)
  (setq org-log-state-notes-insert-after-drawers nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

My =org-todo-keywords= are set as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-todo-keywords
        (quote ((sequence  "TODO(t)"  "NEXT(n)"  "|"  "DONE(d)")
                (sequence  "WAITING(w@/!)"  "HOLD(h@/!)"  "|"  "CANCELLED(c@/!)"  "PHONE"  "MEETING"))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This adds a log entry whenever a task moves to any of the following states:

- to or out of =DONE= status
- to =WAITING= status (with a note) or out of =WAITING= status
- to =HOLD= status
- to =CANCELLED= status (with a note) or out of =CANCELLED= status

I keep clock times and states in the =LOGBOOK= drawer to keep my tasks uncluttered. If a task is WAITING then the reason for why it is waiting is near the top of the LOGBOOK and unfolding the LOGBOOK drawer provides that information. From the agenda simply hitting =SPC= on the task will reveal the LOGBOOK drawer.

****** <<sec-18-13>> 18.13 Limiting time spent on tasks


Org-mode has this great new feature for signalling alarms when the estimated time for a task is reached. I use this to limit the amount of time I spend on a task during the day.

As an example, I've been working on this document for over two months now. I want to get it finished but I can't just work on it solely until it's done because then nothing else gets done. I want to do a little bit every day but limit the total amount of time I spend documenting org-mode to an hour a day.

To this end I have a task

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   *  NEXT  Document my use of org-mode
    :LOGBOOK:...
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL: today
     :Effort:   1:00
     :END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

The task has an estimated effort of 1 hour and when I clock in the task it gives me a total in the mode-line like this

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  --:**  org-mode.org   91% (2348,73) Git:master  (Org Fly yas Font)-----[0:35/1:00 (Document my use of org-mode)]-------
#+END_EXAMPLE

I've spent 35 minutes of my 1 hour so far today on this document and other help on IRC.

I set up an alarm so the Star Trek door chime goes off when the total estimated time is hit. (Yes I'm a Trekkie :) )

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-clock-sound  "/usr/local/lib/tngchime.wav")
#+END_EXAMPLE

When the one hour time limit is hit the alarm sound goes off and a message states that I should be done working on this task. If I switch tasks and try to clock in this task again I get the sound each and every time I clock in the task. This nags me to go work on something else :)

You can use similar setups for repeated tasks. By default the last repeat time is recorded as a property when a repeating task is marked done. For repeating tasks the mode-line clock total counts since the last repeat time by default. This lets you accumulate time over multiple days and counts towards your estimated effort limit.

****** <<sec-18-14>> 18.14 Habit Tracking


John Wiegley recently added support for Habit tracking to org-mode.

I have lots of habits (some bad) but I'd still like to improve and build new good habits. This is what habit tracking is for. It shows a graph on the agenda of how well you have been doing on developing your habits.

I have habits like:

- Hand wash the dishes
- 30 minute brisk walk
- Clean the house

etc. and most of these need a push to get done regularly. Logging of the done state needs to be enabled for habit tracking to work.

A habit is just like a regular task except it has a special =PROPERTY= value setting and a special =SCHEDULED= date entry like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   *  TODO  Update Org Mode Doc
     SCHEDULED:  <2009-11-21 Sat .+7d/30d>
     [2009-11-14 Sat 11:45]
     :PROPERTIES:
     :STYLE: habit
     :END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

This marks the task as a habit and separates it from the regular task display on the agenda. When you mark a habit done it shows up on your daily agenda the next time based on the first interval in the SCHEDULED entry ( =.+7d=)

The special =SCHEDULED= entry states that I want to do this every day but at least every 2 days. If I go 3 days without marking it DONE it shows up RED on the agenda indicating that I have been neglecting this habit.

The world isn't going to end if you neglect your habits. You can hide and display habits quickly using the =K= key on the agenda.

These are my settings for habit tracking.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;  Enable habit tracking (and a bunch of other modules)
  (setq org-modules (quote (org-bbdb

#+END_EXAMPLE

During the day I'll turn off the habit display in the agenda with =K=. This is a persistent setting and since I leave my Emacs running for days at a time my habit display doesn't come back. To make sure I look at the habits daily I have the following settings to redisplay the habits in the agenda each day. This turns the habit display on again at 6AM each morning.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-15>> 18.15 Habits only log DONE state changes


I tend to keep habits under a level 1 task =* Habits= with a special logging property that only logs changes to the =DONE= state. This allows me to cancel a habit and not record a timestamp for it since that messes up the habit graph. Cancelling a habit just to get it off my agenda because it's undoable (like get up before 6AM) should not mark the habit as done today. I only cancel habits that repeat every day.

My habit tasks look as follows - and I tend to have one in every org file that can have habits defined

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   * Habits
     :PROPERTIES:
     :LOGGING:  DONE(!)
     :ARCHIVE:  %s_archive::* Habits
     :END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-16>> 18.16 Auto revert mode


I use git to synchronize my org-mode files between my laptop and my workstation. This normally requires saving all the current changes, pushing to a bare repo, and fetching on the other system. After that I need to revert all of my org-mode files to get the updated information.

I used to use =org-revert-all-org-buffers= but have since discovered =global-auto-revert-mode=. With this setting any files that change on disk where there are no changes in the buffer automatically revert to the on-disk version.

This is perfect for synchronizing my org-mode files between systems.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (global-auto-revert-mode t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-17>> 18.17 Handling Encryption


I used to keep my encrypted data like account passwords in a separate GPG encrypted file. Now I keep them in my org-mode files with a special tag instead. Encrypted data is kept in the org-mode file that it is associated with.

=org-crypt= allows you to tag headings with a special tag =crypt= and org-mode can keep data in these headings encrypted when saved to disk. You decrypt the heading temporarily when you need access to the data and org-mode re-encrypts the heading as soon as you save the file.

I use the following setup for encryption:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ( require ' org-crypt)
   ;  Encrypt all entries before saving
  (org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
  (setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote ( "crypt")))
   ;  GPG key to use for encryption
  (setq org-crypt-key  "F0B66B40")
#+END_EXAMPLE

=M-x org-decrypt-entry= will prompt for the passphrase associated with your encryption key and replace the encrypted data where the point is with the plaintext details for your encrypted entry. As soon as you save the file the data is re-encrypted for your key. Encrypting does not require prompting for the passphrase - that's only for looking at the plain text version of the data.

I tend to have a single level 1 encrypted entry per file (like =* Passwords=). I prevent the =crypt= tag from using inheritance so that I don't have encrypted data inside encrypted data. I found =M-x org-decrypt-entries= prompting for the passphrase to decrypt data over and over again (once per entry to decrypt) too inconvenient.

I leave my entries encrypted unless I have to look up data - I decrypt on demand and then save the file again to re-encrypt the data. This keeps the data in plain text as short as possible.

******* <<sec-18-17-1>> 18.17.1 Auto Save Files


Emacs temporarily saves your buffer in an autosave file while you are editing your org buffer and a sufficient number of changes have accumulated. If you have decrypted subtrees in your buffer these will be written to disk in plain text which possibly leaks sensitive information. To combat this org-mode now asks if you want to disable the autosave functionality in this buffer.

Personally I really like the autosave feature. 99% of the time my encrypted entries are perfectly safe to write to the autosave file since they are still encrypted. I tend to decrypt an entry, read the details for what I need to look up and then immediately save the file again with =C-x C-s= which re-encrypts the entry immediately. This pretty much guarantees that my autosave files never have decrypted data stored in them.

I disable the default org crypt auto-save setting as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-crypt-disable-auto-save nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-18>> 18.18 Speed Commands


There's an exciting feature called =org-speed-commands= in the org-mode.

Speed commands allow access to frequently used commands when on the beginning of a headline - similar to one-key agenda commands. Speed commands are user configurable and org-mode provides a good set of default commands.

I have the following speed commands set up in addition to the defaults. I don't use priorities so I override the default settings for the 1, 2, and 3 keys. I also disable cycling with 'c' and add 'q' as a quick way to get back to the agenda and update the current view.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

The variable =org-speed-commands-default= sets a lot of useful defaults for speed command keys. The default keys I use the most are =I= and =O= for clocking in and out and =t= to change todo state.

=J= jumps to the current or last clocking task.

=c= and =C= are disabled so they self insert. I use =TAB= and =S-TAB= for cycling - I don't need =c= and =C= as well. =TAB= works everywhere while =c= and =C= only works on the headline and sometimes I accidentally cycle when I don't intend to.

****** <<sec-18-19>> 18.19 Org Protocol


[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.php][Org protocol]] is a great way to create capture notes in org-mode from other applications. I use this to create tasks to review interesting web pages I visit in Firefox.

I have a special capture template set up for org-protocol to use (set up with the =w= key).

My org-mode setup for org-protocol is really simple. It enables org-protocol and creates a single org-protocol capture template as described in [[#CaptureTemplates][Capture Templates]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ( require ' org-protocol)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The bulk of the setup is in the Firefox application so that C-c c on a page in Firefox will trigger the org-protocol capture template with details of the page I'm currently viewing in firefox.

I set up org-protocol in firefox as described in [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.php#sec-9][Keybindings for Firefox]].

****** <<sec-18-20>> 18.20 Require a final newline when saving files


The following setting was mainly for editing yasnippets where I want to be able to expand a snippet but stay on the same line. I used this mainly for replacing short strings or initials with full names for people during meeting notes. I now use =abbrev-mode-= for this and no longer need this setting.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq require-final-newline nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

When I save a file in Emacs I want a final newline - this fits better with the source code projects I work on. This is the setting I use now:

#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-21>> 18.21 Insert inactive timestamps and exclude from export


I insert inactive timestamps when working on org-mode files.

For remember tasks the timestamp is in the remember template but for regular structure editing I want the timestamp automatically added when I create the headline.

I have a function that is run by an org-mode hook to automatically insert the inactive timestamp whenever a headline is created.

Adding the timestamp can be controlled by =f9 T= which toggles the creation of the timestamp on and off for new headlines.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ( defvar  bh/insert-inactive-timestamp t)

  ( defun  bh/toggle-insert-inactive-timestamp ()
    (interactive)
    (setq bh/insert-inactive-timestamp (not bh/insert-inactive-timestamp))
    (message  "Heading timestamps are %s" ( if bh/insert-inactive-timestamp  "ON"  "OFF")))

  ( defun  bh/insert-inactive-timestamp ()
    (interactive)
    (org-insert-time-stamp nil t t nil nil nil))

  ( defun  bh/insert-heading-inactive-timestamp ()
    ( save-excursion
      ( when bh/insert-inactive-timestamp
        (org-return)
        (org-cycle)
        (bh/insert-inactive-timestamp))))

  (add-hook 'org-insert-heading-hook 'bh/insert-heading-inactive-timestamp 'append)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Everytime I create a heading with =M-RET= or =M-S-RET= the hook invokes the function and it inserts an inactive timestamp like this

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   *
     [2009-11-22 Sun 18:45]
#+END_EXAMPLE

This keeps an automatic record of when tasks are created which I find very useful.

I also have a short cut key defined to invoke this function on demand so that I can insert the inactive timestamp anywhere on demand.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (global-set-key (kbd  " t") 'bh/insert-inactive-timestamp)
#+END_EXAMPLE

To prevent the timestamps from being exported in documents I use the following setting

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-export-with-timestamps nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-22>> 18.22 Return follows links


The following setting make =RET= insert a new line instead of opening links. This setting is a love-hate relationship for me. When it first came out I immediately turned it off because I wanted to insert new lines in front of my links and =RET= would open the link instead which at the time I found extremely annoying. Since then I've retrained my fingers to hit RET at the end of the previous line.

****** <<sec-18-24>> 18.24 Meeting Notes


I take meeting notes with org-mode. I record meeting conversations in point-form using org-mode lists. If action items are decided on in the meeting I'll denote them with a bullet and a TODO: or DONE: flag.

A meeting is a task and it is complete when the meeting is over. The body of the task records all of the interesting meeting details. If TODO items are created in the meeting I make separate TODO tasks from those.

I use the function =bh/prepare-meeting-notes= to prepare the meeting notes for emailing to the participants (in a fixed-width font like "Courier New"). As soon as the meeting is over the notes are basically ready for distribution -- there's not need to waste lots of time rewriting the minutes before they go out. I haven't bothered with fancy HTML output -- the content is more important than the style.

****** <<sec-18-25>> 18.25 Remove Highlights after changes


I'm finding I use org-occur =C-c / /= a lot when trying to find details in my org-files. The following setting keeps the highlighted results of the search even after modifying the text.

Setting this variable to t will automatically remove the yellow highlights as soon as the buffer is modified.

****** <<sec-18-27>> 18.27 Prefer future dates or not?


By default org-mode prefers dates in the future. This means that if today's date is May 2 and you enter a date for April 30th (2 days ago) org-mode will jump to April 30th of next year. I used to find this annoying when I wanted to look at what happened last Friday since I have to specify the year. Now I've trained my fingers to go back relatively in the agenda with =b= so this isn't really an issue for me anymore.

To make org-mode prefer the current year when entering dates set the following variable

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-read-date-prefer-future nil)
#+END_EXAMPLE

I now have this variable set to ='time= so times before now (with no date specified) will default to tomorrow..

****** <<sec-18-28>> 18.28 Automatically change list bullets


I take point-form notes during meetings. Having the same list bullet for every list level makes it hard to read the details when lists are indented more than 3 levels.

****** <<sec-18-29>> 18.29 Remove indentation on agenda tags view


I don't like the indented view for sublevels on a tags match in the agenda but I want to see all matching tasks (including sublevels) when I do a agenda tag search ( =F12 m=).

To make all of the matched headings for a tag show at the same level in the agenda set the following variable:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-tags-match-list-sublevels t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-30>> 18.30 Fontify source blocks natively


I use babel for including source blocks in my documents with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   #+begin_src LANG
  ,  ...
   #+end_src
#+END_EXAMPLE

where LANG specifies the language to use (ditaa, dot, sh, emacs-lisp, etc) This displays the language contents fontified in both the org-mode source buffer and the exported document.

See this [[#git-sync][Git Repository synchronization]] in this document for an example..

****** <<sec-18-31>> 18.31 Agenda persistent filters


This is a great feature! Persistent agenda filters means if you limit a search with =/ TAB SomeTag= the agenda remembers this filter until you change it.

Enable persistent filters with the following variable

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-agenda-persistent-filter t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The current filter is displayed in the modeline as ={+SomeTag}= so you can easily see what filter currently applies to your agenda view.

I use this with =FILETAGS= to limit the displayed results to a single client or context.

****** <<sec-18-32>> 18.32 Add tags for flagged entries


Everyone so often something will come along that is really important and you know you want to be able to find it back fast sometime in the future.

For these types of notes and tasks I add a special =:FLAGGED:= tag. This tag gets a special fast-key =?= which matches the search key in the agenda for flagged items. See [[#OrgTagAlist][Tags]] for the setup of =org-tag-alist= for the =FLAGGED= entry.

Finding flagged entries is then simple - just =F12 ?= and you get them all.

****** <<sec-18-33>> 18.33 Mail links open compose-mail


The following setting makes org-mode open =mailto:= links using compose-mail.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-link-mailto-program (quote (compose-mail  "%a"  "%s")))
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-34>> 18.34 Composing mail from org mode subtrees


It's possible to create mail from an org-mode subtree. I use =C-c M-o= to start an email message with the details filled in from the current subtree. I use this for repeating reminder tasks where I need to send an email to someone else. The email contents are already contained in the org-mode subtree and all I need to do is =C-c M-o= and any minor edits before sending it off.

****** <<sec-18-35>> 18.35 Use smex for M-x ido-completion


I discovered smex for IDO-completion for M-x commands after reading a post of the org-mode mailing list. I actually use M-x a lot now because IDO completion is so easy.

Here's the smex setup I use

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name  "~/.emacs.d"))
  ( require ' smex)
  (smex-initialize)

  (global-set-key (kbd  "M-x") 'smex)
  (global-set-key (kbd  "C-x x") 'smex)
  (global-set-key (kbd  "M-X") 'smex-major-mode-commands)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-36>> 18.36 Use Emacs bookmarks for fast navigation


I've started using emacs bookmarks to save a location and return to it easily. Normally I want to get back to my currently clocking task and that's easy - just hit =F11=. When I'm working down a long checklist I find it convenient to set a bookmark on the next item to check, then go away and work on it, and return to the checkbox to mark it done.

I use Emacs bookmarks for this setup as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Bookmark handling
   ;;
  (global-set-key (kbd  "") '( lambda () (interactive) (bookmark-set  "SAVED")))
  (global-set-key (kbd  "") '( lambda () (interactive) (bookmark-jump  "SAVED")))
#+END_EXAMPLE

When I want to save the current location I just hit =C-f6= and then I can return to it with =f6= anytime. I overwrite the same bookmark each time I set a new position.

****** <<sec-18-37>> 18.37 Using org-mime to email


I'm experimenting with sending mime mail from org. I've added =C-c M=o= key bindings in the =org-mode-hook= to generate mail from an org-mode subtree.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ( require ' org-mime)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-38>> 18.38 Remove multiple state change log details from the agenda


I skip multiple timestamps for the same entry in the agenda view with the following setting.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-agenda-skip-additional-timestamps-same-entry t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

This removes the clutter of extra state change log details when multiple timestamps exist in a single entry.

****** <<sec-18-39>> 18.39 Drop old style references in tables


I drop the old A3/B4 style references from tables when editing with the following setting.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-table-use-standard-references (quote from))
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-40>> 18.40 Use system settings for file-application selection


To get consistent applications for opening tasks I set the =org-file-apps= variable as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-file-apps (quote ((auto-mode . emacs)
                              ( "\\.mm\\'" . system)
                              ( "\\.x?html?\\'" . system)
                              ( "\\.pdf\\'" . system))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This uses the entries defined in my system =mailcap= settings when opening file extensions. This gives me consistent behaviour when opening an link to some HTML file with =C-c C-o= or when previewing an export.

****** <<sec-18-41>> 18.41 Use the current window for the agenda

Org mode can fold (cycle) plain lists.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-cycle-include-plain-lists t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

I find this setting useful when I have repeating tasks with lots of sublists with checkboxes. I can fold the completed list entries and focus on what is remaining easily.

****** <<sec-18-44>> 18.44 Showing source block syntax highlighting


It is possible to display org-mode source blocks fontified in their native mode. This allows colourization of keywords for C and shell script source etc. If I edit the source I use =C-c '= (control-c single quote) to bring up the source window which is then rendered with syntax highlighting in the native mode. This setting also shows the syntax highlighting when viewing in the org-mode buffer.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-45>> 18.45 Inserting Structure Template Blocks


There is a shortcut key sequence in org-mode to insert structure templates quickly into your org files.

I use example and source blocks often in my org files.

| Key Sequence | Expands to                        |
|--------------+-----------------------------------|
| < s TAB      | #+begin_src ... #+end_src         |
| < e TAB      | #+begin_example ... #+end_example |

I've added a block for saving email text which I copy from MS Outlook at work so I have context associated with my org-mode tasks.

The following lisp makes the blocks lowercase instead of the default upper case in org-mode.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-structure-template-alist
        (quote (( "s"  "#+begin_src ?\n\n#+end_src"  "\n\n")
                ( "e"  "#+begin_example\n?\n#+end_example"  "\n?\n")
                ( "q"  "#+begin_quote\n?\n#+end_quote"  "\n?\n")
                ( "v"  "#+begin_verse\n?\n#+end_verse"  "\n?\n")
                ( "c"  "#+begin_center\n?\n#+end_center"  "\n?\n")
                ( "l"  "#+begin_latex\n?\n#+end_latex"  "\n?\n")
                ( "L"  "#+latex: "  "?")
                ( "h"  ""  "\n?\n")
                ( "H"  "#+html: "  "?")
                ( "a"  "#+begin_ascii\n?\n#+end_ascii")
                ( "A"  "#+ascii: ")
                ( "i"  "#+index: ?"  "#+index: ?")

#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-46>> 18.46 NEXT is for tasks


=NEXT= keywords are for *tasks* and not *projects*. I've added a function to the todo state change hook and clock in hook so that any parent tasks marked =NEXT= automagically change from =NEXT= to =TODO= since they are now projects and not tasks.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ( defun  bh/mark-next-parent-tasks-todo ()

****** <<sec-18-51>> 18.51 Preserving source block indentation


I do not preserve indentation for source blocks mainly because this doesn't look nice with indented org-files. The only reason I've found to preserve indentation is when TABs in files need to be preserved (e.g. Makefiles). I don't normally edit these files in org-mode so I leave this setting turned off.

I've changed the default block indentation so that it is not indented from the text in the org file. This allows editing source blocks in place without requiring use of =C-c '= so that code lines up correctly.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-src-preserve-indentation nil)
  (setq org-edit-src-content-indentation 0)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-18-52>> 18.52 Prevent editing invisible text


The following setting prevents accidentally editing hidden text when the point is inside a folded region. This can happen if you are in the body of a heading and globally fold the org-file with =S-TAB=

I find invisible edits (and undo's) hard to deal with so now I can't edit invisible text. =C-c C-r= (org-reveal) will display where the point is if it is buried in invisible text to allow editing again.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-catch-invisible-edits 'error)

****** <<sec-18-54>> 18.54 Keep clock durations in hours


The default for clock durations has changed to include days which is 24 hours. At work I like to think of a day as 6 hours of work (the rest of the time is lost in meetings and other overhead on average) so displaying clock durations in days doesn't make sense to me.

The following setting displays clock durations (from =C-c C-x C-d= in hours and minutes.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-19-4>> 19.4 Yasnippet


[[http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/][Yasnippet]] is cool but I don't use this anymore. I've replaced yasnippet with a combination of =abbrev-mode= and =skeletons= which are available by default in Emacs.

The following description applies to yasnippet version 0.5.10. The setup requirements may have changed with newer versions.

You type the snippet name and =TAB= and yasnippet expands the name with the contents of the snippet text - substituting snippet variables as appropriate.

Yasnippet comes with lots of snippets for programming languages. I used a few babel related snippets with =org-mode=.

I downloaded and installed the unbundled version of yasnippet so that I can edit the predefined snippets. I unpacked the yasnippet software in my =~/.emacs.d/plugins= directory, renamed =yasnippet0.5.10= to =yasnippet= and added the following setup in my =.emacs=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name  "~/.emacs.d/plugins"))

  ( require ' yasnippet)
  (yas/initialize)
  (yas/load-directory  "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet/snippets")

   ;;  Make TAB the yas trigger key in the org-mode-hook and enable flyspell mode and autofill
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            ( lambda ()
               ;;  yasnippet
              (make-variable-buffer-local 'yas/trigger-key)
              (org-set-local 'yas/trigger-key [tab])
              (define-key yas/keymap [tab] 'yas/next-field-group)
               ;;  flyspell mode for spell checking everywhere
              (flyspell-mode 1)
               ;;  auto-fill mode on
              (auto-fill-mode 1)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

I used snippets for the following:

- =begin= for generic =#+begin_= blocks
- =dot= for graphviz
- =uml= for PlantUML graphics
- =sh= for bash shell scripts
- =elisp= for emacs lisp code
- initials of a person converts to their full name I used this while taking meeting notes

Here is the definition for the =begin= snippet:

org-mode Yasnippet: ~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet/snippets/text-mode/org-mode/begin

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #name : #+begin_...#+end_
  # --
  #+begin_$1 $2
  $0
  #+end_$1
#+END_EXAMPLE

I used this to create =#+begin_*= blocks like

- =#+begin_example=
- =#+begin_src=
- etc.

Simply type =begin= and then =TAB= it replaces the =begin= text with the snippet contents. Then type =src TAB emacs-lisp TAB= and your snippet block is done. I've shortened this specific sequence to just =elisp TAB= since I use it fairly often.

Hit =C-c SingeQuote(')= and insert whatever emacs-lisp code you need. While in this block you're in a mode that knows how to format and colourize emacs lisp code as you enter it which is really nice. =C-c SingleQuote(')= exits back to org-mode. This recognizes any emacs editing mode so all you have to do is enter the appropriate mode name for the block.

=dot=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #dot : #+begin_src dot ... #+end_src
  # --
  #+begin_src dot :file $1 :cmdline -Kdot -Tpng
  $0
  #+end_src
#+END_EXAMPLE

=uml=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #uml : #+begin_src plantuml ... #+end_src
  # --
  #+begin_src plantuml :file $1
  $0
  #+end_src
#+END_EXAMPLE

=sh=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #sh: #+begin_src sh ... #+end_src
  # --
  #+begin_src sh :results output
  $0
  #+end_src
#+END_EXAMPLE

=elisp=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #elisp : #+begin_src emacs-lisp ...#+end_src emacs-lisp
  # --
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  $0
  #+end_src
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is a great time saver.

****** <<sec-19-5>> 19.5 Show headings at odd levels only or odd-even levels


This has been replaced by org-indent-mode

I've converted my files between odd-levels-only and odd-even using the functions =org-convert-to-odd-levels= and =org-convert-to-oddeven-levels= functions a number of times. I ended up going back to odd-even levels to reduce the amount of leading whitespace on tasks. I didn't find that lining up the headlines and tasks in odd-levels-only to be all that helpful.

****** <<sec-19-6>> 19.6 Propagate STARTED to parent tasks


I used to have a =STARTED= and =NEXT= task state. These were basically the same except =STARTED= indicated that I've clocked some time on the task. Since then I've just moved to using =NEXT= for this.

The following code used to propagate the =STARTED= task up the project tree but I don't use this anymore.

When a task is marked =STARTED= (either manually or by clocking it in) the =STARTED= state propagates up the tree to any parent tasks of this task that are =TODO= or =NEXT=. As soon as I work on the first =NEXT= task in a tree the project is also marked =STARTED=. This helps me keep track of things that are in progress.

Here's the setup I use to propagate =STARTED= to parent tasks:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   ;;  Mark parent tasks as started
  ( defvar  bh/mark-parent-tasks-started nil)

  ( defun  bh/mark-parent-tasks-started ()
     "Visit each parent task and change TODO states to STARTED"
    ( unless bh/mark-parent-tasks-started

I have a key binding in my window manager that runs a script which starts the clock on my testing task, runs the BZFlag client, and on exit resumes the clock on the previous clocking task.

The testing task has an ID property of =dcf55180-2a18-460e-8abb-a9f02f0893be= and the following elisp code starts the clock on this task.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ( defun  bh/clock-in-bzflagt-task ()
    (interactive)
    (bh/clock-in-task-by-id  "dcf55180-2a18-460e-8abb-a9f02f0893be"))
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is invoked by a bash shell script as follows:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   # !/bin/ sh
  emacsclient -e  '(bh/clock-in-bzflagt-task)'
  ~/git/bzflag/trunk/bzflag/src/bzflag/bzflag -directory ~/git/bzflag/trunk/bzflag/data $ *
  emacsclient -e  '(bh/resume-clock)'
#+END_EXAMPLE

The resume clock function just returns the clock to the previous clocking task

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ( defun  bh/resume-clock ()
    (interactive)
    ( if (marker-buffer org-clock-interrupted-task)
        (org-with-point-at org-clock-interrupted-task
          (org-clock-in))
      (org-clock-out)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

If no task was clocking =bh/resume-clock= just stops the clock.

****** <<sec-19-8>> 19.8 q buries the agenda view buffer


With [[#StickyAgendas][Sticky Agendas]] burying the buffer is the default behaviour for the =q= key so this is not needed anymore.

I change the =q= key in the agenda so instead of killing the agenda buffer it merely buries it to the end of the buffer list. This allows me to pull it back up quickly with the =q= speed key or =f9 f9= and regenerate the results with =g=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (add-hook 'org-agenda-mode-hook
            ( lambda ()
              (define-key org-agenda-mode-map  "q" 'bury-buffer))
            'append)
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-19-9>> 19.9 Task Priorities


I use the agenda to figure out what to do work on next. I don't use priorities at all normally but at work I occasionally get priorities from my manager. In this case I mark my tasks with the priorities from the external source just to track the values and force the agenda to display tasks in the priority order.

I use priorities A-E where tasks without a specific priority are lowest priority E.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (setq org-enable-priority-commands t)
  (setq org-default-priority ?E)
  (setq org-lowest-priority ?E)
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** <<sec-20>> 20 Using Git for Automatic History, Backups, and Synchronization


Editing folded regions of your org-mode file can be hazardous to your data. My method for dealing with this is to put my org files in a =Git= source repository.

My setup saves all of my org-files every hour and creates a commit with my changes automatically. This lets me go back in time and view the state of my org files for any given hour over the lifetime of the document. I've used this once or twice to recover data I accidentally removed while editing folded regions.

****** <<sec-20-1>> 20.1 Automatic Hourly Commits


My Emacs setup saves all org buffers at 1 minute before the hour using the following code in my =.emacs=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (run-at-time  "00:59" 3600 'org-save-all-org-buffers)
#+END_EXAMPLE

A =cron= job runs at the top of the hour to commit any changes just saved by the call to =org-save-all-org-buffers= above. I use a script to create the commits so that I can run it on demand to easily commit all modified work when moving from one machine to another.

=crontab= details:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  0 * * * * ~/bin/org-git-sync.sh >/dev/null
#+END_EXAMPLE

******* <<sec-20-1-1>> 20.1.1 ~/bin/org-git-sync.sh


Here is the shell script I use to create a =git= commit for each of my org-repositories. This loops through multiple repositories and commits any modified files. I have the following org-mode repositories:

- org

  for all of my organization project files and todo lists

- doc-norang.ca

  for any changes to documents under [[http://doc.norang.ca/]]

- www.norang.ca

  for any changes to my other website [[http://www.norang.ca/]]

This script does not create empty commits - =git= only creates a commit if something was modified.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   # !/bin/ sh
   #  Add org file changes to the repository
   REPOS= "org doc.norang.ca www.norang.ca"

   for REPO  in $ REPOS
   do
       echo  "Repository: $REPO"
       cd ~/git/$ REPO
       #  Remove deleted files
      git ls-files --deleted -z | xargs -0 git rm >/dev/null 2>&1
       #  Add new files
      git add . >/dev/null 2>&1
      git commit -m  "$( date )"
   done
#+END_EXAMPLE

I use the following =.gitignore= file in my org-mode =git= repositories to keep export generated files out of my =git= repositories. If I include a graphic from some other source than ditaa or graphviz then I'll add it to the repository manually. By default all PNG graphic files are ignored (since I assume they are produced by ditaa during export)

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  core
  core.*
  *.html
  *~
  .#*
  \#*\#
  *.txt
  *.tex
  *.aux
  *.dvi
  *.log
  *.out
  *.ics
  *.pdf
  *.xml
  *.org-source
  *.png
  *.toc
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** <<sec-20-2>> 20.2 Git - Edit files with confidence


I use =git= in all of my directories where editing a file should be tracked.

This means I can edit files with confidence. I'm free to change stuff and break things because it won't matter. It's easy to go back to a previous working version or to see exactly what changed since the last commit. This is great when editing configuration files (such as apache webserver, bind9 DNS configurations, etc.)

I find this extremely useful where your edits might break things and having =git= tracking the changes means if you break it you can just go back to the previous working version easily. This is also true for package upgrades for software where the upgrade modifies the configuration files.

I have every version of my edits in a local =git= repository.

****** <<sec-20-3>> 20.3 Git Repository synchronization


I acquired a Eee PC 1000 HE which now serves as my main road-warrior laptop replacing my 6 year old Toshiba Tecra S1.

I have a server on my LAN that hosts bare git repositories for all of my projects. The problem I was facing is I have to leave in 5 minutes and want to make sure I have up-to-date copies of everything I work on when I take it on the road (without Internet access).

To solve this I use a server with bare git repositories on it. This includes my org-mode repositories as well as any other git repositories I'm interested in.

Just before I leave I run the =git-sync= script on my workstation to update the bare git repositories and then I run it again on my Eee PC to update all my local repositories on the laptop. For any repositories that give errors due to non-fast-forward merges I manually merge as required and rerun =git-sync= until it reports no errors. This normally takes a minute or two to do. Then I grab my Eee PC and leave. When I'm on the road I have full up-to-date history of all my git repositories.

The =git-sync= script replaces my previous scripts with an all-in-one tool that basically does this:

- for each repository on the current system

  - fetch objects from the remote
  - for each branch that tracks a remote branch

    - Check if the ref can be moved

      - fast-forwards if behind the remote repository and is fast-forwardable
      - Does nothing if ref is up to date
      - Pushes ref to remote repository if ref is ahead of remote repository and fast-forwardable
      - Fails if ref and remote have diverged

This automatically advances changes on my 35+ git repositories with minimal manual intervention. The only time I need to manually do something in a repository is when I make changes on my Eee PC and my workstation at the same time - so that a merge is required.

Here is the =git-sync= script

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   # !/bin/ sh
   #

   #  Local bare repository name
   syncrepo=norang
   reporoot=~/git

   #  Display repository name only once

     printf  "  $1\n"
  }

   #  fast-forward reference $1 to $syncrepo/$1
  fast_forward_ref() {

[[/tags/emacs/][#emacs]] | [[/tags/gnu/][#GNU]] | [[/tags/org/][#org]] | [[/tags/programming/][#programming]]

*** June 21, 2020


*** Intro


This is the second post in the serie of how I use Emacs [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] (from now on org) and it will cover usage of [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tables.html#Tables][org tables]]. Some of the content assumes basic knowledge about org. If you are new to org I can recommend this two videos; [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4][hrs]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgizHHd7nOo][kitchin]].

Org tables are like spreadsheets with super powers. Tables can be used to keep information organized, as input to source blocks (more about that in the first post, "Emacs Org mode source blocks") or used in calculations.

My main usage of tables is to calculate work time. I sum up the time I should work and the time I have been working and calc the diff.

*** Versions


... of Emacs and Org mode.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+BEGIN_SRC  emacs-lisp
      ( org-version )
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS :
  : 9.3.7

   #+BEGIN_SRC  emacs-lisp
    ( emacs-version )
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS :
  : GNU Emacs 26.3 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.20)
  :  of 2020-05-19
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Emacs config


Without config Emacs don't know how to execute source blocks. This following snippet provides Emacs with the ability to understand a set of languages/applications. The set of languages/applications need to be available in the underlying OS. To get a complete list of languages/applications available in org. A complete list can be found here: [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/src/master/lisp][repo]]. Support for source blocks are available in files prefixed with =ob-=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ( setq  org-confirm-babel-evaluate  nil )

   ( org-babel-do-load-languages
    'org-babel-load-languages
    ' (( emacs-lisp  .  t )
      ( shell  .  t )
      ( scheme  .  t )
      ( python  .  t )
      ( awk  .  t )
      ( clojure  .  t )))
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Table with a name


This example names the table via the =#+NAME:= command. This named table is then used as input to a source block. Here we use =awk= to sum the population in Europe. More about this can be found in the first post, "Emacs Org mode source blocks".

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+NAME : countries
   | Country name | Area | Population | Region        |
   |--------------+------+------------+---------------|
   | USSR         | 8649 |        275 | Asia          |
   | Canada       | 3852 |         25 | North America |
   | China        | 3705 |       1032 | Asia          |
   | USA          | 3615 |        237 | North America |
   | Brazil       | 3286 |        134 | South America |
   | India        | 1267 |        746 | Asia          |
   | Mexico       |  762 |         78 | North America |
   | France       |  211 |         55 | Europe        |
   | Japan        |  144 |        120 | Asia          |
   | Germany      |   96 |         61 | Europe        |
   | England      |   94 |         56 | Europe        |

   #+BEGIN_SRC  awk  :stdin countries
      /Europe/  {  sum +=  $ 3  }
     END  {  print  "Sum of the population in Europe is" ,  sum }
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS :
  : Sum of the population in Europe is 172
#+END_EXAMPLE

Data is taken from the book [[https://ia802309.us.archive.org/25/items/pdfy-MgN0H1joIoDVoIC7/The_AWK_Programming_Language.pdf][The AWK Programming Language]].

*** Calculate sums


Just like the previous example this one will do calculations based on data in a table. But this on will use table formulas ( =TBLFM=) to do the calculations. This time the table wont be passed to a programming language outside of Emacs. In the "before" we have some items with amount and cost data. We would like to know the amount * cost for each row and the sum of all "Total" rows.

By putting the pointer on the =TBLFM= formula and use the keyboard sequence =C-c C-c= the calculations will be executed.

Org docs on [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-spreadsheet-lisp-formulas.html][table formulas]] and [[https://orgmode.org/org.html#Advanced-features][advanced features]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   Before  =TBLFM= is evaluated

   | Description | Amounts | Cost | Total |
   |-------------+---------+------+-------|
   | Item 1      |       5 |   10 |       |
   | Item 2      |       1 |   55 |       |
   | Item 3      |      20 |   10 |       |
   | Item 4      |    1000 |    1 |       |
   |-------------+---------+------+-------|
   | Sum:        |         |      |       |
   #+TBLFM : $4=$2*$3::@>$4=vsum(@<<$4..@>>$4)

  After  =TBLFM= is evaluated

   | Description | Amounts | Cost | Total |
   |-------------+---------+------+-------|
   | Item 1      |       5 |   10 |    50 |
   | Item 2      |       1 |   55 |    55 |
   | Item 3      |      20 |   10 |   200 |
   | Item 4      |    1000 |    1 |  1000 |
   |-------------+---------+------+-------|
   | Sum:        |         |      |  1305 |
   #+TBLFM : $4=$2*$3::@>$4=vsum(@<<$4..@>>$4)
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Calculate with time


This is more or less the same as in previous example but this time we have a =U= in the =TBLFM= and that tells org to calculate time. Org have many different ways of manage time, more about that [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Durations-and-time-values.html][here]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   Before  =TBLFM= is evaluated

   | Task  |  Time |
   |-------+-------|
   | Taks1 |  8:00 |
   | Task2 |  0:30 |
   | Task3 |  2:00 |
   |-------+-------|
   | Total |       |
   #+TBLFM : @>$2=vsum(@<<$2..@>>$2);U

  After  =TBLFM= is evaluated

   | Task  |  Time |
   |-------+-------|
   | Taks1 |  8:00 |
   | Task2 |  0:30 |
   | Task3 |  2:00 |
   |-------+-------|
   | Total | 10:30 |
   #+TBLFM : @>$2=vsum(@<<$2..@>>$2);U
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Calculate work time


This is an example on how I use tables to make sure that I work my hours.

At my current work we have 40 hours a week freely distributed, no 8-17. As I am a person that like routines I often try to do 8-17 but I am not to strict about it. Working some hours in the night or on weekends is normal. I have a setup where I schedule 8 hours of work every weekday (5*8=40). And to keep track that I really do that I use a table together with some Emacs LiSP code and a =TBLFM= formula. If I am sick or on vacation I put "0:00" in "Worked". This tells the LiSP code to not add "8:00" hours in the "Should work" spot. And if I work hours on a weekend that day should not add extra "8:00" to "Should work".

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+BEGIN_SRC  emacs-lisp  :results none
      ( defun  jh/hours-a-day  ( date  time )
       ( if  ( string-equal  time  "0:00" )
           ""
         ( if  ( or  ( string-match  " Mon"  date )
                 ( string-match  " Tue"  date )
                 ( string-match  " Wed"  date )
                 ( string-match  " Thu"  date )
                 ( string-match  " Fri"  date ))
             "8:00"  "" )))
   #+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

The example contains multiple =TBLFM=, eval them one by one from the top to the bottom.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

*** Logbook and clocktable


This example is not about tables but headlines, drawers and clocktable will be part of a bigger example later.

So, org have headlines. A headline is a row that starts with one or more =*=. The number of =*= declares the depth of the sub headline. In this example =Work= is headline, =[2020-06-10 Wed] Deployed server= and =[2020-06-11 Thu] Updated deps= are sub headlines. Here is headline [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Headlines.html][docs]].

Drawers are values associated with a headline. In this case we use =LOGBOOK= drawer and each =LOGBOOK= have one or more =CLOCK= entries. Each =CLOCK= entry is a datetime range.

Clocktable is a report on =CLOCK= entries. It asks for a =scope= and finds clocking information from it. In this case the =scope= is the current buffer. To eval a clocktable, put the pointer on =#+BEGIN:= row and use =C-c C-c=. Here is the doc on [[https://orgmode.org/manual/The-clock-table.html#The-clock-table][clocktable]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+BEGIN:  clocktable  :scope file :maxlevel 2
   # +CAPTION: Clock summary at [2020-06-21 Sun 21:03]
   | Headline                             | Time    |      |

   #+END:

   ** [2020-06-11 Thu] Updated deps
      :LOGBOOK:
       CLOCK: [2020-06-11 Thu 13:00]--[2020-06-11 Thu 17:00] =>  4:00
       :END:

   ** [2020-06-10 Wed] Deployed server
      :LOGBOOK:

      CLOCK: [2020-06-10 Wed 13:00]--[2020-06-10 Wed 17:00] =>  4:00
       :END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

HINT: *Total time* format may differ. Look here: [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22720526/set-clock-table-duration-format-for-emacs-org-mode][how to change *Total time* format]].

*** Composed example


This example combines many of the features we have gone through. The main idea here is a headline with sub headlines. Each sub headline contains a date and a optional text together with clocking information. This file scope is used by clocktable to generate a report. After the report is generated a formula is executed on the table. This formula is pretty extensive. But the main things is to calculate the "Worked" and "Should work" columns and subtract "Should work" with "Worked" to show how many hours I have left to work.

This example depends on the =jh/hours-a-day= LiSP snippet.

The example below states that I have one more hour to work before I have completed my 40 hours.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    *  Timetable

     #+BEGIN:  clocktable  :scope file :compact t :formula "$3='(jh/hours-a-day $1 $2)'::@3$3=vsum(@4$3..@>$3);U::@1$2=string(\"Worked|\")::@1$3=string(\"Should work\")::@2$2=vsum(@4$2..@>$2)-vsum(@4$3..@>$3);U::@2$1=string(\"Hour pool\")"

*** Nice things I didn't cover


Sub headlines with logbook entries can be created really fast from custom templates. Take a look at [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html][capture templates]].

Clocking commands can be used on sub headlines to start and stop timing. More info [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Clocking-commands.html][here]].

****** Post updates


- [2020-06-23] New section. "Combine source blocks"

****** Intro


It's time to start documenting how I use Emacs [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] (from now on org) and it will contain a serie of posts. This is the first post and it will cover source blocks. Some of the content assumes basic knowledge about org. If you are new to org I can recommend this two videos; [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4][hrs]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgizHHd7nOo][kitchin]].

One of the features I've been using very frequently is source blocks. The power of evaluating code directly from a block and get the results back into the document is really convenient. While reading [[https://ia802309.us.archive.org/25/items/pdfy-MgN0H1joIoDVoIC7/The_AWK_Programming_Language.pdf][The AWK Programming Language]] I took notes and did all of the =awk= programming withing source blocks. This makes me able to have notes, code and execution results in the same document. And as everything is just text, it's easy to version control!

This is the structure of a source block. Org mode's documentation on source blocks can be found [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html#Working-with-Source-Code][here]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+BEGIN_SRC

   #+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

Header arguments differ for different languages and applications. Look in the documentation for your specific language/application to find out what and how to use it.

****** Versions


... of Emacs and Org mode.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+BEGIN_SRC  emacs-lisp
      ( org-version )
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS :
  : 9.3.7

   #+BEGIN_SRC  emacs-lisp
    ( emacs-version )
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS :
  : GNU Emacs 26.3 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.24.20)
  :  of 2020-05-19
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** Emacs config


Without config Emacs don't know how to execute source blocks. This following snippet provides Emacs with the ability to understand a set of languages/applications. The set of languages/applications need to be available in the underlying OS. To get a complete list of languages/applications available in org. A complete list can be found here: [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/src/master/lisp][repo]]. Support for source blocks are available in files prefixed with =ob-=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ( setq  org-confirm-babel-evaluate  nil )

   ( org-babel-do-load-languages
    'org-babel-load-languages
    ' (( emacs-lisp  .  t )
      ( shell  .  t )   ; in my case /bin/bash
      ( scheme  .  t )
      ( python  .  t )
      ( ledger  .  t )
      ( sed  .  t )
      ( awk  .  t )
      ( clojure  .  t )))
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** Bash echo


This small example uses bash to evaluate the =echo= command. Evaluation is done by moving the pointer to the source block and press the key sequence =C-c C-c=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   What shell am I using?

   #+BEGIN_SRC  shell
      echo  $SHELL
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS :
  : /bin/bash
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** Echo input variables


Arguments can be passed to source blocks from the document. This example passes 2 =:var=, *ARG1* and *ARG2*. The command get the arguments and uses them in the command.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+BEGIN_SRC  shell  :var ARG1="FOO" ARG2="BAR"
      echo  $ARG1  $ARG2
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS :
  : FOO BAR
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** Document variables


Lets elaborate on argument to source blocks even further. Org documents can contain variables that holds data. This example contains a org table with the variable name =my-list=. =my-list= is passed as an argument to the Python source block via the variable =lst=. When executed by Python the =lst= data structure is a vector with vectors.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+NAME : my-list
   | A | 1 |
   | B | 2 |
   | C | 3 |

  my-list is a variable in this org document and can be passed in as data to a
  source code block.

   #+BEGIN_SRC  python  :results output :var lst=my-list
      print ( lst )
   #+END_SRC

  The data structure that will be passed to the source block is a vector or
  vectors.

   #+RESULTS :
  : [['A', 1], ['B', 2], ['C', 3]]

  Just like with a normal Python application you can manipulate the data.

   #+BEGIN_SRC  python  :results raw :var lst=my-list
      return  [[ chr (( ord ( x ) + 1 )),  y + 1 ]  for  x , y  in  lst ]
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS :
  [['B', 2], ['C', 3], ['D', 4]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** Result output


Results output can be in many different shapes. Raw output, tables, as code and many more. Output results are described with the =:results= switch in the source block header. This post won't go more into details but more information can be found [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html][here]].

****** More on document variables


This example provides another org document variable. In this case the =text-example= text block. The text in that block is passed as an argument to the =awk= source block. =awk= is a programming language with good features to manipulate text. It can take text from *stdin*. That's exactly what is happening here. Often you see =awk= used in shell commands, similar to this: =cat /etc/passwd | awk -F":" '{ print $1 }'=. Here =awk= gets *stdin* data from the pipe. But in our source block it gets *stdin* data from the org document.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+NAME : text-example
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Item1 100
    Item2 200
    Item3 50
   #+END_EXAMPLE

  Sum field nr 2.

   #+BEGIN_SRC  awk  :results table :stdin text-example
      BEGIN  { OFS = "|" };  {  sum +=  $ 2 };  END  {  print  "Sum" ,  sum }
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS :
   | Sum | 350 |
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** File from file system


This example is very similar to the one in [[#headline-4]["Echo input variables"]]. It passed a variable to the source block that tells a file path to =awk=. =awk= is then called with that *:in-file* as an argument.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   Get system users that have  =/bin/bash= access.

   #+BEGIN_SRC  awk  :results table :in-file /etc/passwd
      BEGIN  {  FS = ":" }
     $ 7  ==  "/bin/bash"  {  print  $ 1 }
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS :
   | root |
   | john |
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** Combine source blocks


It's possible to combine text from different source blocks with the =:noweb yes= header argument. This example shows a ledger that's split up into income and expenses source blocks. They are then combined in the =balance= source block. Ledger is a plaintext accounting tool and can create a balance report from our assets, income and expenses. The =:noweb= header arguments in not something that is specific for ledger.

Docs on =:noweb= header argument can be found [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html][here]]. Docs on ledger can be found [[https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html#Org-mode-with-Babel][here]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+NAME : income
   #+BEGIN_SRC  ledger
     2020-06-24 * Sold old computer
        Assets:Bank:Card                         5000.00
        Income:Secondhand                       -5000.00
    2020-06-25 * Salary
        Assets:Bank:Card                        25000.00
        Income:Work:Salary                     -25000.00
   #+END_SRC

   #+NAME : expenses
   #+BEGIN_SRC  ledger
     2020-06-23 * Rent
        Expenses:Rent                            3000.00
        Assets:Bank:Card                        -3000.00
    2020-06-24 * Gas
        Expenses:Cas:Gas                         3000.00
        Assets:Bank:Card                        -3000.00
   #+END_SRC

   #+NAME : balance
   #+BEGIN_SRC  ledger  :noweb yes
     <>
    <>
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS : balance
  :                24000  Assets:Bank:Card
  :                 6000  Expenses
  :                 3000    Cas:Gas
  :                 3000    Rent
  :               -30000  Income
  :                -5000    Secondhand
  :               -25000    Work:Salary
  : --------------------
  :                    0
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** Combine results and source blocks


Now lets use the result from one source block as argument to another. The example requires some files with a =.awk= ending to be present in =/tmp=. We use =bash= to get data about our file system. That result is then feed to =awk= that creates a good looking table. That table is then sent to Python for further processing.

There is nothing different here from the other examples except that in this case we use =#+NAME:= on source blocks instead of a text blocks or a tables. The results from the named source blocks will then be available as input to other source blocks.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   List files ending with .awk in  /tmp/ dir.

   #+NAME : ls-output
   #+BEGIN_SRC  shell  :dir /tmp :results output
     ls -la *.awk
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS : ls-output
  : -rw-r--r-- 1 john users 492 Jun 15 11:46 awk-play.awk
  : -rw-r--r-- 1 john users 396 Jun 15 13:10 copy-line-on-confirm.awk
  : -rw-r--r-- 1 john users 412 Jun 15 12:25 filter-google-chromepasswords.awk

  Take only size and filename and return a table.

   #+NAME : ls-output-table
   #+BEGIN_SRC  awk  :results table :stdin ls-output
      BEGIN  {  OFS = "|"  };  {  print  $ 5 ,  $ 9 }
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS : ls-output-table
   | 492 | awk-play.awk                      |
   | 396 | copy-line-on-confirm.awk          |
   | 412 | filter-google-chromepasswords.awk |

  Process the table with Python.

   #+BEGIN_SRC  python  :results output :var table=ls-output-table
      print ( table )
     print ( max ( table ))                               # Biggest awk file
     print ( min ( table ))                               # Smallest awk file
     print ( sum ([ x  for  x , y  in  table ])  /  1000  ,  "kb" )  # Sum of all awk files
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS :
  : [[492, 'awk-play.awk'],
  :  [396, 'copy-line-on-confirm.awk'],
  :  [412, 'filter-google-chromepasswords.awk']]
  : [492, 'awk-play.awk']
  : [396, 'copy-line-on-confirm.awk']
  : 1.3 kb
#+END_EXAMPLE

****** Nice things I didn't cover


Org have ways to execute code on remote servers via source blocks. This is awesome and can be used for DevOps. I have used it in cases where an Ansible playbook is overkill. There is a really nice blog post and video about this stuff [[http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html][here]].

Source blocks can also be written to the file system via the header switch =:tangle=. This is also very useful. More info about that can be found [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][here]].

****** Conclusion


I think org is truly an amazing piece of software. With very little effort from the user it can provide a very rich and interactive experience with a lot of applications and languages. From the document view everything is just text so version control a org document is very simple.

********* Intro


This is the third post in a series about Emacs Org mode and the second about source code blocks.

The last post about source code blocks (blocks from now on) covered org document variables, named blocks and combining blocks.

This post will focus on how and where block result output will end up. It won't cover all of the arguments and features as I don't use all of them. If you wanna get the full picture, here is the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html#Results-of-Evaluation][docs]].

********* Versions


Since last post a new Emacs version 27.1 have been released! Here are some about the release, [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-08/msg00237.html][news]].

I haven't covered this type of blocks before. They are called "inline code block" and is very useful when doing one liners that returns a single value. The documentation on inline code blocks can be found [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-of-Code-Blocks.html][here]].

Here are the "inline code blocks" used to show what versions of the software I am currently using.

     src_emacs-lisp{emacs-version}  {{{results(=27.1=)}}}
    src_emacs-lisp{org-version}  {{{results(=9.4=)}}}
#+END_EXAMPLE

********* Default argument


Results from source block evaluation can appear in many different shapes. As list, as source block, as "raw", to file and so on.

This is how it end up if no argument if provided.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+BEGIN_SRC  shell
        echo  "Hello Emacs"
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : Hello Emacs
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is the same as the argument =:results output=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+BEGIN_SRC  shell  :results output
        echo  "Hello Emacs"
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : Hello Emacs
#+END_EXAMPLE

********* Output code


Lets output the result into a new source code block. By default the new block gets the same language as the parent. In this case the language is shell.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+BEGIN_SRC  shell  :results output code
        echo  "Hello Emacs"
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
     #+begin_src  shell
     Hello Emacs
     #+end_src
#+END_EXAMPLE

If the output language is not the same as the parent. =:wrap= can be used to tell what language the result block will get.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+BEGIN_SRC  shell  :results output code :wrap src text
        echo  "Hello Emacs"
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
     #+begin_src  text
     Hello Emacs
     #+end_src
#+END_EXAMPLE

********* Append results


Results can be appended into the org document. In this case the block have been evaluated three times. I don't use this very often.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+BEGIN_SRC  shell  :results output append
       date + '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : 2020-08-29 11:52:34
    : 2020-08-29 11:52:36
    : 2020-08-29 11:52:38
#+END_EXAMPLE

********* Table


Results can end up in nicely formatted org tables

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+BEGIN_SRC  shell  :results table
       ps -a
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
     |     PID | TTY   |     TIME | CMD      |
     |    5456 | tty1  | 00:00:00 | swaybg   |
     |    5468 | tty1  | 00:00:49 | swaybar  |
     |    5479 | tty1  | 00:01:12 | sh       |
     |    5937 | tty1  | 00:07:14 | Xwayland |
     | 1279652 | pts/0 | 00:00:03 | hugo     |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Or what about a nice looking NetworkManager table.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+BEGIN_SRC  shell
       nmcli -g name,type,device con  | awk  'BEGIN{FS=":"; OFS="\t"};{print $1, $2, $3}'
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
     | iPhone             | 802-11-wireless | wlp0s20f3     |
     | integrity_vpn      | wireguard       | integrity_vpn |
#+END_EXAMPLE

********* File


Results can be written to a file. In the results area a org link to the file containing the results is provided.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+BEGIN_SRC  shell  :results file :file script.sh
      echo  "#!/bin/bash"
     echo  "echo Hey"
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    [[ file:script.sh]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here is a larger case. Write the results to a file. The filename should be =script.sh= and be written in folder =/tmp=. The file should also have execute permissions for all three user types. This =:file-mode= argument came in Org version 9.4.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #+HEADER: :results file
    #+HEADER: :file script.sh
    #+HEADER: :output-dir /tmp
    #+HEADER: :file-mode (identity #o777)
     #+BEGIN_SRC  emacs-lisp
        "#!/bin/bash\necho Hello World"
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    [[ file:/tmp/script.sh]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Let's look on the attributes of the =script.sh= file.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+BEGIN_SRC  shell  :results output code :dir /tmp
       ls -la  | grep script.sh
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
     #+begin_src  shell
     -r-xr-xr-x   1 nils users    28 Aug  29 11:59 script.sh
     #+end_src
#+END_EXAMPLE

********* Pass result on


Result data from one source block can be passed to another in the same execution. You don't need to run =C-c C-c= two times and have results stored in variables. In the example on bash block generates a string and numbers from 1 to 20. Those two lines are then passed on to the =attr_wrap= named source block. This block takes data from the previous block and append two more lines. One with a string and the other with numbers from 20 to 30.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #+NAME: attr_wrap
     #+BEGIN_SRC  shell  :var data="" :results raw
        echo -n  " $data "
       echo  "... and this appends this"
       echo  {20..30 }
     #+END_SRC

    Evaluate the block below, the upper block will be called
    automatically.

    #+HEADER: :post attr_wrap(data= *this*)
    #+HEADER: :file /tmp/a.txt
    #+HEADER: :results output code
     #+BEGIN_SRC  shell
        echo  "This blocks generates this data"
       echo  {01..10 }
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
     #+begin_src  shell
     This blocks generates this data
     01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  10
    ... and this appends this
     20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30
     #+end_src
#+END_EXAMPLE

********* Tangle


This is a sidestep from source code block results, but it's related. Text within a source code block can be written to a file. Using the =(org-babel-tangle)= function. =(org-babel-tangle)= will look through all of the document and find all of the source code blocks with =:tangle= arguments and write all of them to the local file system.

This example writes some text from a source code block to a file.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+BEGIN_SRC  text  :tangle /tmp/hey-from-org.txt
       This is some text
     #+END_SRC

     #+BEGIN_SRC  shell  :results output code
       cat /tmp/hey-from-org.txt
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
     #+begin_src  shell
     This is some text
     #+end_src
#+END_EXAMPLE

********* Tangled file permissions


Just lite =:file-mode= we have =:tangle-mode= to set file permissions when writing a file to the file system. This example is a small bash script written to the file system and set to be executable for all users.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #+HEADER: :tangle /tmp/hey-org-mode.sh
    #+HEADER: :tangle-mode (identity #o777)
     #+BEGIN_SRC  shell
        #!/bin/bash
       echo  "Hello World"
     #+END_SRC

    Lets check what permissions the file got after tangled.

     #+BEGIN_SRC  shell  :results output code
       ls -la /tmp  | grep hey-org-mode.sh
     #+END_SRC

    The file got  *read*,  *write* and  *execute* for everyone. That's what
    we told in the  =:tange-mode= header.

    #+RESULTS:
     #+begin_src  shell
       -rwxrwxrwx   1 john users       31 Jul  22 11:40 hey-org-mode.sh
     #+end_src
#+END_EXAMPLE

********* Bigger example


This example combines many of the features. And in the end it generates a nicely formatted system report with a org structure.

Lets start by specifying the commands to run in the report.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #+NAME: report-commands
     | Disk usage    | df -h      |
     | Memory usage  | free -h    |
     | Network       | nmcli conn |
     | System time   | date       |
     | System uptime | uptime     |
     | System kernel | uname -a   |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Run the table into a =awk= source code block to format it into a bash script. The result is written to a file and execute permissions are set on the file.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #+HEADER: :stdin report-commands
    #+HEADER: :results file
    #+HEADER: :file /tmp/system-report.sh
    #+HEADER: :file-mode (identity #o744)"
     #+BEGIN_SRC  awk
        BEGIN  {
           FS = "\t"
           print  "#!/bin/bash\n"
           print  "echo \"#+TITLE: $1\""
           print  "echo \"#+DATE: $(date +'%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S')\""
           print  "echo \"#+STARTUP: overview\""
           print  "echo \"\""
       }
       {
           printf ( "echo \"* %s\"\n" ,  $ 1 )
           printf ( "echo \"\"\n" )
           printf ( "echo \"#+BEGIN_SRC shell\"\n" )
           printf ( "echo \"%s\"\n" ,  $ 2 )
           printf ( "echo \"#+END_SRC\"\n" )
           printf ( "echo \"\"\n" )
           printf ( "echo \"#+RESULTS:\"\n" )
           printf ( "echo \"#+BEGIN_SRC text\"\n" )
           printf ( "echo \"$(%s)\"\n" ,  $ 2 )
           printf ( "echo \"#+END_SRC\"\n" )
           printf ( "echo \"\"\n" )
       }
     #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    [[ file:/tmp/system-report.sh]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

The output of the =system-report.sh= will be pretty flat and will not look nice even in org. Lets format it with some level of indentation depending on context. This source block is only responsible for formatting and cant do anything on it's own.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #+NAME: org_format
    #+HEADER: :var data=""
    #+HEADER: :results raw
     #+BEGIN_SRC  shell
        echo -n  " $data "  \
            | awk  '$1~/BEGIN_SRC|RESULTS/,$1~/END_SRC/ { print "   ", $0; next }; { print }'  \
            | awk  '$1~/^#+/ {gsub(/^[ \t]+/, "  ", $0) ; print; next}; { print }'
     #+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

Let run the script and pass it though the format source code block.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #+HEADER: :dir /tmp
    #+HEADER: :post org_format(data= *this*)
    #+HEADER: :results output code
    #+HEADER: :wrap src org
     #+BEGIN_SRC  shell
       ./system-report.sh  "Daily system report"
     #+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

And voila, here is the result! The report is well formatted and looks very good.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     #+TITLE: Daily system report
    #+DATE: 10-11-2020 21:06:41
    #+STARTUP: overview

     * Disk usage

       #+BEGIN_SRC  shell
         df -h
       #+END_SRC
